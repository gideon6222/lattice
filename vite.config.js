              changes, while game code changes constantly. Keeping them apart
              means a gameplay tweak invalidates ~20 kB instead of ~506 kB,
              which is the difference between a fast PWA update on mobile data
              and a slow one.

           2. It makes the bundle size guard actually work. In one combined
              chunk, the frame loop going missing showed up as a 1.57% drop -
              inside any sane tolerance. As its own chunk the game code is

             naming it 'three' here defeated exactly that, pulling 82 KB into
             the chunk every first paint waits on. The size guard caught it as a
