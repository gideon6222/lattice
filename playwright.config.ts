  /* 4319, and NOT 4173 or 4200, on purpose.

     Several games are built on this machine at once and sometimes literally at
     the same moment. Both of those ports are Vite defaults, so the sibling game
     was serving its own build on 4173 while this suite ran - and because
     `reuseExistingServer` is true off CI, Playwright adopted that server rather
     than starting one. The tests then pointed at another game entirely, and
     when its run finished and tore the server down, half of this suite failed
     with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED partway through.

     The failure looked like flake and was not: it was one repo's tests loading
     a different repo's app. A per-game port makes reuse safe again, because the
     only thing that can be listening is this game. The interactive preview in
     .claude/launch.json deliberately sits on a different port again, so opening
     the game to look at it can never disturb a test run. */
