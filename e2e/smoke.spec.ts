/* Smoke test against the production build.

   This exists because of a specific incident: the module split dropped the
   final line of the entry point, requestAnimationFrame(frame). Every golden
   test passed, the typecheck was clean and the build succeeded. The game
   booted, drew a single frame and sat there forever. It was caught by noticing
   the bundle had shrunk.

   So the load-bearing assertion here is "the frame loop advances". The rest is
   cheap insurance for the same class of wiring bug: a broken import, a missing
   DOM id (mustEl throws on those now), a boot-order regression.

   Everything below waits on game STATE, never on wall-clock time. The frame
   loop clamps its delta to 50 ms, so on a machine without a GPU the game
   advances in slow motion under load and any fixed sleep becomes a flake. */

/* The budget for anything still waiting on real time.

   45 s, under the 60 s suite timeout, so a poll can actually run out and report
   what it was waiting for instead of dying inside a test timeout.

   Raised from 30 s because the move to PBR shaders made every remaining
   wall-clock test more marginal at once: CI has no GPU, falls back to a
   software rasteriser, and a heavier fragment shader there costs real time that
   the game then advances in slow motion to pay for. Two tests tipped over.

   This is headroom, not a fix. The fix is the tick seam - anything that
   accumulates over GAME time belongs on advance(), where a slow machine costs
   nothing. Tests still using this are ones that only need a second or two. */

/* Hold a direction and run GAME time until a condition holds, rather than
   waiting on the wall clock.

   `holdUntil` above presses the same button and then waits for real seconds to
   pass, which is fine when there is a GPU and marginal when there is not. CI
   has no GPU, falls back to a software rasteriser, and the suite has grown a
   1400-mote dust field and per-world weather since these budgets were set: the
   sell test needed more than its 45 seconds to fly back up to the pad and went
   red on CI while passing locally in a third of the time.

   PIPELINE.md already names the fix and it is not a bigger timeout: *"anything
   that accumulates over GAME time belongs on advance(), where a slow machine
   costs nothing."* The button is still pressed with a real pointer event, so
   the input path is exercised exactly as before; only the waiting changes.

   Advanced in one-second slices with a check between them, so a hold cannot
   overshoot by more than a second - which matters for the directions where
   holding too long drives into something. */

/* Draw-call budget.

   Terrain is drawn with InstancedMesh. Before that, every block was its own
   mesh with its own material, which measured 207 draw calls underground against
   a mobile guideline of about 50. Instancing took it to 35.

   That is easy to lose silently: anything that gives blocks per-instance
   materials, or adds a per-object mesh to the streaming window, puts it
   straight back. It costs nothing on a desktop and shows up on the phone.

   Counted by wrapping the GL context rather than reading renderer.info, which
   is module-scoped and not reachable from here.

   ---

   **150, and it is a regression detector, not a ceiling.** The old value of 70
   came from a "roughly 50 to 100 on mobile" rule of thumb, which turns out to
   be off by more than an order of magnitude for what this game actually does.

   Measured on 2026-09-08 by adding sub-pixel meshes to the real scene at the
   worst case and timing whole frames through the tick seam - so this is draw
   CALL overhead, isolated from fill rate and vertex work:

       79 calls   0.64 ms      819 calls   3.66 ms
      119 calls   0.75 ms     1519 calls   7.27 ms
      219 calls   1.19 ms     2519 calls  12.88 ms
      419 calls   1.88 ms

   Dead linear at **5.0 us per draw call**. The game's 60 calls cost 0.64 ms,
   which is 3.8% of a 60 fps frame, and it would take about **3,200 calls** to
   miss 60 fps on this machine. A phone's driver overhead is worse - call it a
   few times - which still leaves the real ceiling in the high hundreds at
   minimum, ten to twenty times what the game uses.

   So the number here exists to catch ONE thing: instancing silently breaking
   and every block becoming its own mesh again, which measured 207 back when
   the world was much smaller and would be far higher now. 150 catches that
   decisively while leaving room for ordinary feature work to land without a
   budget edit. Raise it deliberately if a feature genuinely needs it; the
   thing to be alarmed by is a jump, not a number. */

   The research for this round ranked input buffering first. MEASURED, it is

   timescale a buffer could bridge is ordnance with an empty meter, and

   nothing. What IS wrong is upstream of that. The d-pad keys are 60 px with a
   5 px gap, about 10 mm on his phone against a thumb nearer 18 mm, and the
   keys bound `pointerleave` to a release. So a thumb that drifts a couple of
   millimetres mid-dig stops the ship and says nothing, and a thumb that slides
   from one key to the next dead-ends: leave fires on the key it left, and

     Anchors' mint and is now violet, because the permanence moved to the dark
     core and the map is where a player reads the history of what they broke.
     That took the rings out of this count entirely, which is why the numbers
     below all fell and why the threshold had to be re-derived rather than
     nudged. The three states, counted on this fixture at 375x812:

       nothing lit .......................  51 mint pixels
       three broken, names NOT calmed ....  49   (the violet rings count zero)
       three broken, names calmed ........ 502

     Before Y13 those were 50, 539 and 1057: the middle row was the rings by
     themselves, and the old +700 existed precisely to sit above it. It no
     longer has to, because a mint pixel on this map is now a region NAME and
     nothing else - which makes the test stricter than it was, not looser.

     Verified by planting exactly the fault it is for: the calmed name colour
     set back to the ordinary one gives 49 against 51, and the assertion fails.
     Re-measure if the font, the canvas size, the fixture or the ring colour
