/* The planet answering.

   Terraria's Hardmode edits the world the player already has rather than
   building more of it, and that is the whole of W8. Three changes fire at the
   fifth Anchor of nine, and each of them has a way of being wrong that looks
   fine from the outside:

   1. UNREST STEPS, once. A step that can be paid twice - by a save reload, by
      a ninth Anchor - is a planet that quietly ratchets itself to maximum.
   2. THE GROUND CLOSES, and it must never close the way out, never close
      quiet ground, and never close with rock.
   3. SOMETHING GROWS, and it must generate NOWHERE before the wake, or the
      whole device is just an ore nobody noticed.

   And one that is not a mechanism at all but is the reason this exists: waking
   the planet has to be worth doing. */
