/* Test-only entry point. Re-exports the pure modules so the harness can bundle
   exactly one thing and get everything the golden tests need.

   None of these touch the DOM, three.js or the audio context, which is why they
   can run under node at all. Keep it that way: if importing this ever starts
   pulling in a renderer, the split has leaked. */
