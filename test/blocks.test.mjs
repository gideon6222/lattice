/* ---------- pockets and caves ----------

   These were added on their own seed offsets specifically so that adding them
   could not reshuffle the ore stream. The frozen snapshot below is the world
   as it stood the moment before they existed, and the test asserts the only
   legal difference: a cell either kept its old id, or a cave/gas/geode
   overwrote it. Anything else means a new generation feature perturbed the
   rolls underneath it, which silently rebalances every depth at once.

   FROZEN, AND RE-FROZEN ONCE - in round seven, 2026-09-10.

   The file used to be the world as it stood the moment before caves, gas and
   geodes existed, which is where the name came from. Round seven rebalanced
   the ore table on purpose: the ladder spread from five worlds to eight, the
   deep tier went from 0.40-2.10% down to 0.12-0.30%, and total density fell by
   a quarter. That is the one change the rule above always said would need a
   re-record, and it is the first time it has been used.

   MEASURED BEFORE RE-RECORDING, NOT AFTER. Of 15,639 cells: 11,053 changed
   rock band, which M5 already licensed as rock-for-rock; 841 changed from one
   ore to another; 574 stopped being ore and 368 started. That is about six per
   cent of cells changing ore STATUS, against a deliberate density cut from 10%
   to 7.5%. Nothing in the diff was a surprise.

   What the file means now is "the world as it stood after round seven". What
   the TEST means is unchanged: a new feature may overwrite cells and may not
   move the ore underneath them. That property does not care which fixed point
   it is measured from - which is why re-freezing costs nothing except a name
   that had stopped being true, so the name went with it.
