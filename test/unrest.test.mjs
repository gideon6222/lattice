/* Unrest and the Ballast.

   The Claim's tests proved three buildings took damage and that repairing them
   put the numbers back. None of that survives, and it should not: the
   properties worth holding are different now, because the thing at stake is
   different.

   Four of them, and they are the ones that stop this system being either
   toothless or a death spiral:

   1. Digging is what makes the ground angry, it costs more the deeper you go,
      and nowhere is free.
   2. The Ballast runs out on a clock a player can plan against, and feeding it
      costs something they wanted for something else.
   3. A collapse can never take the pad's region, the ship's region, or a
      region that is already down.
   4. A collapse leaves a planet you can come back from. */
