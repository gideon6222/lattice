<#
  The session's own status line, for the studio dashboard.

  A game session calls this after each commit and again before it stops and reports, so the
  dashboard can answer the one question the site could not: what is this game's Claude
  session doing right now, and is it stopped waiting for Gideon. It writes one small file,
  build\session-status.json, which is gitignored like everything else under build\.

  It holds only what nothing else knows: the state, the prose, and the head and branch the
  session is sitting on. No version, no milestone counts, no gate result - the dashboard's
  agent\collect.ps1 already derives all three from the repo and PLAN.md, and one source per
  fact is INDEX.md rule 10. A second copy here would go stale the moment a commit landed.

  Two sessions in one game repo is last writer wins, deliberately. There is no lock: the
  utc and head fields are what make the overwrite visible to a reader rather than silent.

  It never throws and always exits 0. It is called from inside a build loop, and a status
  line that can break a commit is worse than no status line at all.
