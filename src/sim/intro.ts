/* The way in: the first-run intro, the title, and CONTINUE.

   Playtest, 2026-09-12, on v0.32.0: *"redo the intro completely. I want it to
   have more of an eerie and high quality feel to it that matches the rest of
   the game. If there are any transitions from flying in a cutscene to landing,
   I want an actual transition, not just a cut. I want a very short intro after
   hitting the continue button as well. It should only take a few seconds to
   start playing again."*

   And on v0.33.0, an hour later: *"I like the intro a lot more now ... When
   you hit continue at the start screen, have the same starting point as new
   game but move the camera to the launch pad faster and don't display the
   text."*

   The first was a restatement from scratch, a day after the captions had
   been rewritten over the same picture - so the picture was wrong, not the
   words. The picture was a second scene: a starfield, billiard-ball worlds
   under a sun, and a white flash to hide the cut into the game. Everything he
   has ever praised in this game is dark rock under a lamp.

   So the way in plays IN THE GAME'S OWN SCENE, with the game's own camera,
   lamp, rock and pad, and there is nothing to cut between. The research
   (plans/lattice/REFERENCE.md) says the same thing three ways: God of War
   and Half-Life 2 never build a second camera; Limbo's dread is silence
   broken by one sound; Hollow Knight shows the world before the character.

   ONE SHAPE, TWO SPEEDS. The title screen is the first Anchor's hall in the
   dark, the Anchor's own glow the only light. From there:

     NEW GAME   tap. A cold light breathes up over the cut stone - the hall
                the first descent will cut into. One low sound. One line.
                The eye climbs to the surface through dark rock. The pad at
                night, one line. The ship's lamp comes down out of the dark;
                the ground wakes under it; touchdown, one line, controls.
     CONTINUE   the same, in under four seconds, with no words.

   THE EYE AND THE SHIP ARE TWO THINGS. The eye is where the world streams
   and the lamp floods from and the camera looks; the ship is where the ship
   is. For most of the way in there is no ship. The renderer reads both from
   `eyeOn(way, t)` every frame and knows nothing about phases.

   Pure, so a test can walk it: where the eye starts is derived from the
   Anchor table rather than typed, and every number below is a second or a
   metre. */
