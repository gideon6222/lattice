   The ship used to hop cell to cell on a fixed timer, which made every metre a

   speed and how fast the ship coasts to a stop. Both are exponential, so
   neither depends on frame rate, and both are deliberately fast: this is a
   game played with a thumb on a d-pad, and anything that reads as momentum
   also reads as the controls being late.

   Round twelve, V9. The story research's last technique: the ending should SHOW

   yours. There is more of it than you have seen."* and then puts you back in a
   frame eighteen rows tall.

   Deliberately the camera DISTANCE and nothing else. The framing in `resize()`
   is eighteen rows solved against the panel and multiplied by the Scanner, and
   it took five sessions of lighting work to calibrate - a bespoke ending camera
   would be a second framing to keep in step with the first. `camZBoost` is an
   additive scalar that already exists for exactly this shape of thing, so the
   ending is a number added to it and the whole of the existing frame logic is
   untouched.

   The curve: rise, hold, fall. The hold is what makes it a SHOT rather than a
   lurch - a pull-back that immediately returns reads as a camera error, and the
   research's point is that the player should get a moment to look at what they
   dug. Six seconds total against a card they are reading anyway.

   bought a slightly warmer wall and nothing else.

   is a second, omnidirectional, unshadowed term at this fraction of the beam,

   space full of dust with light bouncing around in it from every wall; a rock
   face is a surface, and a surface the beam is not on is simply dark. Sharing
   one bounce figure between them made every branch read as a hole.

   The two ended up close together, which is not the same as being the same

   lesson about tuning around a bug.

   It was 0.62. Hiding the haze quad showed that the angular shapes players
   were complaining about were drawn by the haze, so it was cut to 0.20 - which
   did remove them, and also took a lot of warmth out of the game. The next
   playtest was *"it looks like it is happening worse now than it was and I
   liked the art style before better."*

   Both halves were right. The shapes were in the haze, but the haze was only
   REVEALING them: the fan was recording the far corner of each wall cell, so
   occlusion against angle was a staircase and the single lamp drew as several
   cones. See rayHit in light.ts. Turning this down made the cones dimmer, not
   fewer, and paid for it in every scene that never had them.

   With the fan fixed the cones are gone at 0.62 as well, so the darkening was
   never the fix and most of it is given back. 0.45 rather than the old 0.62
   because at 0.62 a crossing tunnel still fills to a fairly even band, and the
   whole job of the number is that a branch the beam has passed reads as dim
   lit air rather than as either a hole or a panel of colour.

   air far enough ahead to be lit - which is a branch you are approaching, and

   This is the fix for a circle of light that survived deleting a halo sprite
   AND zeroing a deliberate spill, because it was never either of those: it is
   what bilinear filtering does to a one-texel spike.

   The light grid is one texel per CELL, and a tunnel is one cell wide, so the
   open channel is a single 255 with 0 on both sides. Sampled with LinearFilter
   that ramps to zero only at the neighbouring texel's centre - a full cell into
   the rock, in every direction. A one-cell corridor therefore paints a
   three-cell soft blob, which is exactly the "circle of light around the ship
   that bleeds through the rock" three playtests in a row described.

   The mask is hard (255 open, 0 solid), so across a one-cell corridor the
   interpolated value runs 0.5 at the wall, 1.0 at the centre, 0.5 at the far
   wall. Mapping that range back onto 0..1 puts the glow exactly inside the
   corridor: brightest down the middle, fading to nothing AT the rock face
   rather than a cell past it.

   Since the grid went to three texels per cell the ramp is already only a
   third of a cell wide and centred on the boundary, so these no longer have to
   claw a whole cell back - they just keep the last sliver of glow off the rock

   Playtest: *"I want digging to cost a much larger amount of fuel than just

   chance of getting back safely."*

   The instinct is right and the diagnosis was not the ratio. MEASURED against
   the old per-second model: one cell of rock already cost about six times a
   metre of flight. What it did not do was STAY expensive.

     leg   tank   fuel per basalt cell   climb home   cells a tank buys
      0      90          5.02             15 (17%)          14

   The Drill divides the seconds a cell takes, the Tank multiplies the supply,
   and the two compound. By the end of the ladder a full tank is seven hundred
   and sixty cells of the hardest rock in the game, which is not a resource, it
   is a formality - and fuel stopped being a constraint at exactly the depth
   where the stakes were highest.

   So fuel is charged against PROGRESS THROUGH THE CELL rather than against
   time spent drilling. A cell costs what it costs; a better Drill gets through
   it faster and pays the same.

   **The Drill buys speed and never efficiency.** That one sentence is the
   whole change, and it is what keeps the constraint alive at every level. The
   ladder that buys efficiency is the Scrubber, which is a separate decision
   with a separate price.

   So the reactor idles. A slow drain the whole time you are underground, and
   nothing at the pad. It closes the hole - stranded now always ends - and it
   quietly makes fuel a clock as well as a budget, which is the Subnautica
   oxygen shape and the right one for a game where the resource is your life.
