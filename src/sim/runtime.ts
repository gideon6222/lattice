/* Shared mutable loop state.

   These were plain `let` bindings at the top of app.ts. Once the file is split
   they are written in one module and read in another, and you cannot assign to
   an imported binding — `import { shake } from ...; shake = 0.5` is a compile
   error. So they live on one mutable object, exactly the way `g` already does.

   Only state that genuinely crosses a module boundary belongs here. Things the
   frame loop alone touches (camZBoost, freeze, thrustLevel, bank, last,
   skyTick) stay local to loop.ts, and per-module caches (lastRow, pHead,
   resetArmed) stay with their module. */
