/* ---------- the palette of a world ----------

   A planet used to BE two sky colours. Everything underground - the rock, the
   fog, the haze in the tunnels, the dust in the beam, the silhouettes behind
   it - was identical on every world in the game, so a new planet was the same
   cave with the horizon repainted, and the traits were weather that happened
   to you rather than anywhere you had been.

   A palette is applied everywhere at once, which is the whole point. The same
   argument as the heat line: one signal is missable, four coordinated ones are
   not. You should know you are somewhere else before you have dug a metre.

   `rock` and `mix` tint the ROCK ONLY, and never the ore. Ore colour is how
   value is read at a glance - amethyst has to look like amethyst on every
   world or the one piece of information the player reads fastest becomes
   unreliable. The host a crystal sits in is rock, so that tints with the rest.

   Below 70 m the only pressure was heat, which is attrition: it charges you

   answer was always "leave a bit sooner". Dome Keeper's tension comes from a
   recurring event on a rhythm rather than a drain, and that is what this is.

   Past TREMOR_DEPTH the ground periodically shifts and fills in some of the
   tunnel you dug. It never touches where you are standing - it takes the way
   OUT. So depth stops being a number you push and becomes a commitment: the
   further down you are when one lands, the worse your route home gets, and the
   more of your remaining fuel goes on re-digging it.

   Deliberately deeper than the heat line, so the world reads in three bands
   rather than two: quiet, hot, and unstable. 85 m leaves a 25 m window on

   everyone starts on. */

   blockAt() walks this list and takes the first entry whose depth gate is met,

   claim cells the next one up would have taken - which is what makes adding a
   new deepest ore a narrow overwrite rather than a reshuffle of the whole
   table. There is a test on that ordering; break it and every depth on every
   planet quietly rebalances.

   Umbrite and Solmarrow exist because the ladder used to stop at 185 m while

/* ---------- the ore ladder ----------

   Playtest: *"I want there to be way less special resources to show up so it
   actually feels like a prize when you get one. you only start seeing new
   resources when you get really deep and even then they are rare."*

   He is describing three separate faults and all three were measured before
   anything here was touched.

   **`chance` is a cumulative threshold, not a probability.** `blockAt` walks
   this list deepest-first and takes the first entry whose `chance` the roll
   falls under, so an ore's real share is the GAP to the one above it - except
   the deepest, which is tested first and keeps its whole number. The old table
   had Solmarrow, worth 132,000 and the most valuable thing in the game, at
   2.10% - four times Umbrite at 0.50% and five times Coreite. The entire deep
   tier was ordered backwards and had been since the day a third ore was added.

   **Density did not vary with depth at all.** One cell in ten was ore at 10 m
   and at 300 m; going deeper only changed which one. There was no scarcity
   curve to feel.

   **Every world showed you almost everything.** Five of eleven materials were
   on the 58-metre tutorial planet.

   So: the ladder now spans EIGHT worlds instead of five, total density is
   about 5% instead of 10%, and the top four are 0.10 to 0.25% instead of 0.40
   to 2.10%. The research is unambiguous that depth is the mechanism that makes
   rarity read - a material that does not exist above its floor is one a player
   who stays shallow never even rolls for, which is what stops a hunt turning
   into a grind. The roll is the second gate, not the first.

   Cores are at 58 + 48 per leg, so a new material arrives on roughly every
   world: copper and iron on the first, silver at the bottom of it, and
   Solmarrow not until 372 m - which is planet seven. */

     player with both has an answer to "where is the value" and "where is the
     point", and they are genuinely different questions - the richest seam on
     the planet is not where the game is going.

     Levels buy REACH and nothing else, because the one thing it must never
     become is a bearing (src/sim/call.ts). A louder instrument that still only

     "that way" turns a mining game into a following game, and no amount of
     tuning gets that back.

     Priced against the Deep Survey and one rung under it: they are the two
     instruments, and this is the cheaper because it does less.

     **3500 is not chosen, it is the only number that fits.** `econ.test.mjs`
     asserts a row unlocking deeper costs more to start, and at 48 m the
     receiver sits between Hull Plating (45 m, 3400) and the Deep Survey (62 m,
     3600). The first two attempts were 2600, which undercut both, and the test
     named each neighbour in turn. The ladder is the price, and the only freedom
     left was where on it this row belongs.

     **`unlock` is 48 and that is the same number as its `below` in finds.ts,
     not a coincidence.** The first version said `unlock: 0`, reasoning that a
     found device is gated by the crate and a second gate would be the
     two-gates mistake the Fuel Tank's note records. That was wrong in a way the
     econ test caught immediately: `unlock` is also the ORDERING key the price
     ladder is checked against, so a row unlocking at 0 for 2600 undercut the
     Magnet at 20 for 1200. The depth a device is buried at and the depth its
     row opens at are one fact (INDEX.md rule 10b), and the other six devices

   Credits alone made the upgrade ladder a pure grind against one number: any

   ever mattered. Past level three each upgrade also wants the mineral it is
   built out of, and the mineral's depth is the actual gate.

   The one that carries the design is the Cooling Rig, which wants emerald from
   78 m - eight metres INSIDE the heat zone. You have to survive a heat run
   without the protection in order to buy the protection. That is the "hit a
   wall, upgrade, get past it" shape the game did not have; everything below
   70 m was previously reachable on day one with enough patience.

   The choice this creates is real because cargo is weight-limited. Six emerald
   is 51 kg of a 60 kg starting hold, and every kilo of it is a kilo not spent

/* Which upgrades belong on the shelf at all.

   Playtest: *"I want future upgrades that dont unlock until later to be

   correcting rather than working around:

     "Locking shop stock behind deepest-ever-reached is the cheapest structural
      progression available, and it should be SHOWN, not hidden: a row that
      says 'Sealed until 90 m' is a reason to go deeper. A hidden row is
      nothing at all."

   That is right about the NEXT gate and wrong about all of them. A case
   reading "Sealed until 90 m" when your best is 78 m is a reason to go deeper.
   The same case when your best is 12 m cannot be planned toward, is five rungs
   away, and is one of five crowding a phone screen. The rule was written when
   there were ten upgrades and two gates; at fifteen and six it stopped being
   true, and it stopped being true quietly because it was being applied rather
   than measured.

   So: everything already unlocked, plus the ONE next thing you have not
   reached. That keeps the whole benefit the rule was defending - there is
   always exactly one visible reason to go deeper - and removes the clutter.
