   and the game's own arithmetic already agreed with him: `findRoute()` paths
   to `key(START_X, -1)` and `climbCells()` costs THAT route, so the reserve
   printed on the fuel dial has always been the fuel needed to reach the PAD.
   `atSurface()` meanwhile answered "is the ship above the ground line", and
   every dock service was hung off it - so flying up any of the 61 columns sold
   the hold, refilled the tank, repaired the hull and landed a pending

   the reserve band on the dial is drawn from that cost, and the Auto-Return
   device flies it for you. The research on every comparable game says the same

   pad, don't lose too much progress, but can't abuse the system."*

   A CHECKPOINT AT THE PAD. The save is only ever written while the ship is
   on the pad, in play; a run in progress when the app closes is simply not
   in it. So CONTINUE always lands you on the pad with the state exactly as
   you left it, and quitting mid-run costs precisely what dying does - the
   hold and the run - and nothing else. That is what closes both abuses at
   once: there is no free ride home with a full hold, and there is no
   quitting out of a death. At most one run, about three minutes, is lost.

   AND AT EVERY LARGE EVENT. *"lets do a second save point at the anchor. If
   there are any large events like this, create save points for them too."*
   Lighting an Anchor, reaching the Vault, recovering a relic, digging up a
   device: each writes a checkpoint where the ship stands, with the tank,
   the hull and the hold as they are at that moment. Quitting after one
   restores that moment, which is exactly what dying would do to a run that
   had passed it - so still nothing to abuse. What a checkpoint rewinds is
   bounded by one run, the same bound the pad save has.

   `snapshot` is the pure half - what would be written, or null when nothing
   should be - so the rule can be tested without a disk. `at` says which
