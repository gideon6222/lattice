/* What changed, in the player's terms.

   The build stamp answers "did my update land". It cannot answer "what is
   actually different", which after a few sessions of work is the question that
   matters more. A commit log is the wrong shape for that - it is written for
   whoever has to maintain the code, and there are eighty of them.

   Rules for entries: describe what the player can now do or see, not what was
   refactored; one line each; newest first. If an entry cannot be written that
   way it probably did not need a version. */

It also brings the tunnel you came down in partly down behind you, so the way home is one you have to find again. Both choices cost you something, which is the point of it.',

The game used to tell you what it wanted once, during the opening, and then never mention it again - so if you came back the next day there was nothing on screen saying what you were down there for.',

They change the resolution, how much dust is in the air, how much grows on the rock and whether the rock has relief. They never change the game: the same reach, the same rules, the same ore.',

      'There is one planet now. It is 61 columns wide and 452 meters deep, and you are going to be here a while.',
      'The twelve worlds became twelve REGIONS of it, three across and four down, each with its own rock, its own color and its own rules. The chip at the top names the one you are standing in.',
      'A MAP. It fills in as you fly, draws your own tunnels exactly, names the places you have been and puts three question marks over the ones you have not.',
      'Buried across the planet are nine ANCHORS, in halls of cut stone somebody built before you got here. You cannot mine one - you break into the hall, cross it, and drop into the niche. Lighting one calms its region, draws the whole region onto your map, and makes the Ballast stronger for the rest of the game.',
      'Three of the nine are behind a seal nothing cuts until you have found the Cutting Laser somewhere else entirely.',
      'The refinery, the derrick and the store shed are gone. In their place the BALLAST: one riveted pressure station on the pad, with a sight glass for the level and a dial whose needle is how angry the planet is.',
      'It drains while you are out working. You feed it banked ore - the same ore the Outfitter wants - so the hold is two decisions now.',
      'If it runs out, a region COMES DOWN. Every tunnel you cut there fills in and you cannot get back in until you have shored it up, which costs 45% of a full Ballast.',
      'UNREST. Everything you cut makes the ground angrier, and it is per region, so working one place out and going somewhere else is a real move. Restless ground shakes at depths that used to be quiet. Nothing tells you what the numbers mean.',
      'At the fifth Anchor the planet answers. Every region steps, permanently; tunnels in restless ground start closing while you are docked; and something new starts growing in the shallow rock you finished with hours ago.',
      'The ninth Anchor opens the center. That is the end of the game, and the game does not throw you out when you finish it.',
      'The star chart, the jump drive and the Planet Core are gone with the old ending. There is one planet and one way to finish it.',
      'Rock got its own character: every block is turned a quarter-turn and scaled a little, the strata boundaries wander instead of ruling straight lines, and cut stone is the only smooth surface in the world.',
      'A new ship, designed at thirty pixels: a boiler, a raked stack, a spoked flywheel and an open under-frame. Brass where brass can cover a whole panel.'

      'You keep every credit you had already banked, every upgrade, every relic and every drive component. The world stays where it is. It is the run you lose, not the save.',
      'Tow Insurance is gone, and every credit anybody spent on it has been refunded.',
      'In its place, the Scrubber: up to 40% off the fuel a cell of rock costs.',
      'Drilling is charged by the cell now, not by the second - so a better Drill gets through rock faster and pays exactly the same for it. A full tank used to be 14 cells of hard rock at the start of the game and 760 by the end of it.',
      'The fuel gauge shows a red band: the fuel it would take to fly home from where you are. It grows as you descend. When the needle gets near it the dial goes red and pulses, and the game tells you to turn back.',
      'The reactor idles, so sitting still underground is no longer free.',
      'Far less ore in the ground, and the deep kinds are properly rare now - Solmarrow was turning up four times as often as Umbrite, which is worth a third as much.',
      'New materials arrive over eight worlds instead of five. Copper, Iron and Silver on the first; Solmarrow not until 372 m, which is the eighth planet.',
      'The first time you ever cut a new material the game stops for a beat, names it, and tells you what it is worth.',
      'Ore is worth more per unit, and the mineral requirements at the top of a ladder stop climbing after the fourth rung.'
