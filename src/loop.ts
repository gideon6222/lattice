         stop... or not make it align until you change direction? I want it to
         ease into a stop."* Both halves of that were the same two mistakes:

         **It assigns, it does not add.** `+=` stacked a correction on top of a
         velocity that was often already carrying the ship toward the lane, so
         the pair overshot, got corrected back, and overshot again. That
         oscillation is the bounce. Assigned, the perpendicular velocity IS the
         exponential approach - it cannot overshoot, because the value is
         exactly the speed that lands on the line and no more. Discarding
         whatever the axis was doing is not a loss either: while you are
         thrusting one way, drift the other way is the thing being removed.

         **Nothing held means no pull at all.** The old version aligned both
         axes while coasting, which is worse than untidy: the nearest lane is as
         often behind the ship as ahead of it, so a release near a cell edge
         hauled the ship BACKWARDS against its own coast. Letting go is now drag
         and nothing else - a clean ease-out that never reverses. The ship comes
         to rest wherever it rests, which costs nothing, because the next
         direction you press aligns it on the way.

     Round twelve, V7. `src/sim/grade.ts` decides which of three acts the
     campaign is in and how hard to pull the frame; this is the only place that
     turns that into renderer state.

     Applied AFTER heat and never before it. The heat line has to read the same
     on every world and in every act or it stops being a threshold the player
     can learn - the note four lines up says so about the palette, and it is
     more true of a grade that follows the campaign than of one that follows
     the world. Act two's tint is the same ember heat already uses, so at the
     bottom of the world in act two the two agree rather than fight.

     Ambient is left alone on purpose. Pulling the ambient colour is how a grade
     becomes a filter: every lighting value in feel.ts was calibrated against a
     white ambient, and CLAUDE.md is explicit that if the world needs to look
     different that is a change to the lights and not to the field. So the act
