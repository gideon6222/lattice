   sequence IS can be walked by a test, what it LOOKS like cannot be tested at
   all, so there is as little as possible in here. The frame loop reads the
   timelines every tick and draws them through the game's own camera - see
   "the way in" in loop.ts - and this file only opens and closes the screens
   over the top.

   THERE IS NO SECOND SCENE ANY MORE. Until 2026-09-12 the title and the intro
   ran on transit.ts: a starfield, planets under a sun, and a white flash to
   hide the cut into the game. *"redo the intro completely ... an eerie and
   high quality feel that matches the rest of the game ... an actual
   transition, not just a cut."* The picture that did not match the game was
   that scene. Everything here now happens in the world the game is played in,
   and the ship's landing is the ship landing. */
