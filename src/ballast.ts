/* The Ballast, standing beside the pad.

   Playtest: *"I want to remove the buildings or redesign them visually and
   their purpose."*

   `unrest.ts` owns the rules; this owns the picture. It replaces the refinery,
   the derrick and the store shed - three silhouettes, three meters, three
   repair prices and one idea - with a single machine that can actually be
   lost, and whose whole state is legible from the air on the way down.

   ---------- what it has to say, and how ----------

   Four readings, and none of them is a number on a HUD:

     HOW FULL IT IS   a sight glass up the side, lit to the level. This is the
                      one you read while landing, so it is the tallest, most
                      vertical thing on the machine - a bar chart you can see
                      at fifty pixels
     HOW HARD IT IS   the pressure dial on the front, whose needle swings with
     WORKING          the planet's Unrest, and the stack, which vents faster as
                      the needle climbs
     HOW FAR YOU      the tier collars. Every Anchor lit stacks another drum
     HAVE COME        section on, so the machine visibly grows over a campaign
                      and the surface tells you where you are without a menu.
                      This is SteamWorld Dig's town, and it is the cheapest
                      legible-progress device the research found
     THAT IT IS       when the Ballast empties the glass goes dark, the dial
     FAILING          pins, and the vent stops. A machine that has stopped
                      moving is the most obvious failure state there is

   ---------- why it is coded and not imported ----------

   Same argument pad.ts made and it has not got weaker: an imported station kit
   arrives with its own topology, its own normals and its own idea of scale,
   and the join to flat-shaded low-poly terrain shows in the first frame. The
   import budget goes to surfaces, where a normal map genuinely cannot be
   written by hand.

   ---------- and it is steampunk, at thirty pixels ----------

   The ship's rule, applied again: at play scale only things that break the
   OUTLINE survive. So the machine is a riveted vertical vessel (a mass), a
   flared stack off-centre (an outline break), an external sight glass and
   pipework standing clear of the body (negative space), and collars that
   change the profile as they stack. The rivets, the brass and the dial face
   are for when you are standing next to it on the pad, which you are, every
   run, for as long as it takes to sell. */
