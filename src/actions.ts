   Playtest: *"I dont want towing to be a thing. if you run out of gas, you
   should game over."*

   A tow used to winch you home and take 10 to 50% of the haul as a fee. That
   is the Super Motherload panic button being handed out free, forever - the
   sequel to the game this one descends from SELLS the rescue as a premium
   one-use item, and the base game just explodes you. He is asking for the base
   game.

   WHAT IS LOST, AND WHERE THE LINE IS. The hold, the run and the ship. Nothing
   else: not a credit already banked, not an upgrade level, not a relic, not a
   drive component, not the world. That line is not caution, it is what the
   research found - across Motherload, SteamWorld Dig, Dome Keeper, Deep Rock,
   Subnautica and Barotrauma, not one game destroys its meta-progression on a
   single failed run. Permadeath modes wipe a RUN or a CHARACTER; the unlocks
   always survive. Losing the whole take is already harsher than SteamWorld Dig
   (half your gold) or Deep Rock (you keep a quarter), and it is the most a
   game with a fifteen-rung ladder can take without the ladder becoming the
   thing you are afraid to risk.

   And the consequence worth naming: THE FUEL CELL IS NOW THE PANIC BUTTON.
   Thirty-five fuel straight into the tank used to be a minor convenience. With
   no tow it is the thing that saves your life, and it is something you have to
   find before you can buy one. An existing mechanic stopped being decoration
   without a line of code. */

/* ---------- an Anchor lights ----------

   The biggest thing that happens in this game short of losing the ship, and
   the only one that is unambiguously good. `POLISH.md`: one event, four
   channels - light, sound, shake, haptic - fired together.

   A MODAL, unlike a device find, and the difference is deliberate. A device
   banner runs itself out over four seconds while the drill keeps turning,
   because a device is a thing you are about to use. An Anchor is the objective
   moving: the Ballast is permanently stronger, a region is now on your map,
   and the machine on the pad has grown. That is worth stopping for, and it is
   the one place in the round where stopping is right.

   The wording says what changed and does NOT say how many are left. The count
   is on the panel at the pad for anybody who wants it; putting "4 of 9" in the
   moment turns a discovery into a checklist, and the research on withheld
   rules is the whole reason this round exists. */

     stays dark until the streaming window happens to rebuild, which is when
     you cross a row - so the one thing the player is looking at is the one
     thing that does not change, and then it changes later for no reason.

   The fifth Anchor of nine. `unrest.ts` decides what it does to the state;
   this is the half the player experiences, and it is the one moment in the
   game where everything stops and the world talks about itself.

   HERE rather than in collapse.ts, which is where the rest of the world-change
   code lives, and for a reason worth writing down: collapse.ts would have had
   to import `showEvent` from this file, and this file would have had to import
   `planetAnswers` from that one. A cycle that happens to work because of the
   order two bindings are read is a trap for whoever moves a call next - and
   this repo has already lost an afternoon to exactly that, with the symptom
   "Cannot access 'k' before initialization" and a shop that never opened.

   The text names the ANCHORS as the cause, because the point is that the
   player did this: it is a consequence of playing well, not weather. And it
   does not say what any of the three changes are in numbers. You find out that
   Blooms exist by cutting one, and that the ground closes by coming back to a
