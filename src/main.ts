   that is ready to run, and starting is a matter of hiding a div rather than

   Behind ?debug, so nothing here exists in a normal load.

   The loop splits into frame(), which asks what time it is, and tick(), which
   takes a delta and does the work. Exposing the second one means a whole run
   compresses into `advance(56)` - deterministically, and far faster than real
   time, because a fixed step does not depend on how quickly the machine booted
   the bundle and only the last step renders.

   Without this, every balance number past the shallow game has to be reached by
   holding a d-pad in a real browser for as long as it would actually take, which
   is why the deep content is still the least tested part of the game.

   The state objects come too. A test that reads the HUD is asserting on a
   rounded string in a formatter, which is a different claim from the one it
   usually means to make: DEPTH 0 m is true at pd 0.0 and at pd 0.49. */
