/* Dust hanging in the air, lit by the ship's lamp.

   Playtest: *"can you create a high definition particle effect for dust in the
   air."*

   There was already a dust field, and the reason it did not read as dust is
   worth keeping written down, because it is not the particle count. It was
   parented to the ship - `dust.position.set(px, py, 0)` every frame, with a
   slow spin on top. A cloud that travels with you is not dust; it is a texture
   on the camera. You can fly a hundred metres and the same motes are in the
   same places.

   So these are anchored in the WORLD and wrap around the ship. Fly down and
   motes rise past you, because they are standing still and you are not. That
   one change does more than any amount of extra geometry, and it costs a
   modulo.

   The rest of "high definition":

     - a soft round sprite instead of the default square point
     - per-mote size, phase and drift, so no two move alike
     - lit by the SAME light field as everything else, on a hard curve, so a
       mote outside the beam is nearly invisible and a mote inside it is a
       bright speck. That contrast is the whole effect - it is what makes the
       beam look like a volume with something in it rather than a gradient
     - denser with depth, which is the "increasingly dense air" half of the ask

   One Points draw for all of them. */

/* A round mote with a soft edge. 128px rather than the 64 of the shared bloom
