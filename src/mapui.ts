/* The map.

   Playtest: *"find more secrets, random caves, and other things to make the
   planet feel mysterious and intriguing ... I dont want to just try to dig to
   the bottom."*

   There was no map in this game of anything. Not of the tunnels, not of where
   you had been, not of what you had found. That is survivable in fifty-eight
   metres of straight-down and fatal in a world that is 61 by 452 and meant to
   be worth exploring - and every mystery device the research names needs one
   to work at all. "Not yet understood" has to read as a tracked goal rather
   than as confusion, and the thing that does the tracking is this.

   Drawn to a canvas rather than built from elements. A fully explored world is
   1,808 seen tiles and can be thousands of dug cells; as divs that is thousands
   of layout boxes, and as fillRect calls it is one node and a couple of
   milliseconds. It only redraws when the screen opens or the finger moves.

   ---------- what is on it ----------

   Four layers, back to front, each answering a different question:

     the UNSEEN      nothing at all. Most of the world, most of the time, and
                     the reason the map is worth opening again later
     the SEEN        a dim wash in the region's own colour: "you have been down
                     this way". Coarse, four cells to a tile
     the TUNNELS     exact, bright, from `dug`. These are yours, and they are
                     what you actually recognise
     the MARKS       the pad, the ship, and where the notable things were

   Region names sit over their own ground, so the map is also where you find
   out that the place you are standing in is called Kryllon - and a region you
   have never entered is three question marks, because a map that lists twelve
   names you have never seen is a table of contents. The research is explicit
   that too many open hooks at once reads as confusion rather than as mystery. */

       Round twelve, V3. Until now the map could tell you where an Anchor was

       about the PLANET: nine rings scattered over four screens of scrolling is
       a list, and reading it is counting.

       A region whose Anchor is lit is calmed, and its name is written in the
       same mint the lit ring uses. That is the whole change, and it is the
       research's point - direction comes from a visible contrast between
       resolved and unresolved that reads at a glance without reading a word.
       The player has already learned that mint means lit from the ring; this
       spends that meaning at region scale instead of inventing a legend.

       Region i holds Anchor i for i < ANCHOR_COUNT, by construction in
