/* The Outfitter, as a room you are standing in.

   Playtest: "can you rearrange how the shop is layed out? make it look like a
   full room where upgrades have a physical model associated with it instead of
   a list of upgrades."

   It was a scrolling list on a styled background, and a list is a list however
   it is dressed. This is a second three.js scene: a hangar bay with the ship
   parked on a deck and the upgrades racked around it in lit display cases.

   Two decisions carry most of the value.

   THE SHIP IN HERE IS THE SHIP. `player` is reparented out of the game scene
   into this one, not copied. The machine on the deck is wearing exactly the
   hardware it will wear when you undock, and buying something changes the thing
   you are looking at. A copy would be a second source of truth and would drift
   inside a single session.

   THE PARTS IN THE CASES ARE THE PARTS. Same geometry, same materials,
   exported from ship.ts as HW. The model on the pedestal is not a picture of
   the upgrade, it is the upgrade - so "what changes in the shop" and "what
   changes in play" cannot disagree, because there is only one set of art.

   Its own scene rather than a corner of the game world, because the lighting
   here wants to be a lit workshop and the game's wants to be a dark hole, and
   one set of lights cannot be both. */

   of height and barely 3.1 of width. A hangar laid out sideways - the obvious

   It was a six-by-six box with a back wall, two returns, ribs, a hazard stripe

   A workshop. Strong key from above and in front so the ship's facets read, a
   cool fill from behind so it is not sitting in a void, and a warm bounce off
   the deck. None of it changes with depth: the point of the room is that it is
   the one place in the game that is properly lit. */
/* Lit for neon, which means lit DARK.

   These were a workshop's lights: a strong warm key, a cool fill and a bright
   ambient, set when this room was a hangar whose job was to show the ship's
   facets clearly. Against the round-six room they were the whole problem. The
   sourced cyberpunk rule is saturated accents against a dark, desaturated
   base - "neon is rationed, not everywhere" - and a base lit to 1.15 ambient
   is not a dark base. The screenshot showed a mid-grey wall with a pink line
   on it, which is the same complaint as round five's in a different disguise:
   the fitting was fine and the room around it was drowning it.

   So the ambient is a third of what it was, the key is less than half, and the
   light that actually falls on the counter you are standing at comes from the
   fitting under its lip. The ship keeps enough key to read, because it is the
   one object in here whose shape is game state.

   The three fixed lights do not count against the neon budget - they are
   directional and ambient, which cost one term each regardless of how many
   fragments they touch. Only the point lights are metered. */

   RIG aisle wherever you happen to be standing. The room hands out its own
   lights now and moves them with the camera - see the note on the roaming
   lights in stationroom.ts - and two modules both lighting the same floor is
   the same "one writer per phase" fault as two modules both drawing it.

   It also freed the eighth light. The scene measured eight real lights against

   Two rows, and the split is by PRICE, which is what a real counter does: the
   dear stock is under glass at the till because that is where it can be
   watched, and the ordinary stock is racked behind because there is more of it
   and nobody needs to be careful with it. The sourced display research says
   the same thing in lighting terms - individual light on few items reads as
   precious, repetition under one flat wash reads as stock.

   on the rack. */

   He was right and the cause was one number. Measured at 360x780 CSS, which is
   the phone at its device pixel ratio: the bar takes the top 120 px, the tray
   takes the bottom 310, and the room is composed into the 350 px between them -

   at y 461 with the tray starting at 470 and the plates hung into it.

   `setViewOffset` SHIFTS the frustum and does not rescale it. That distinction
   took two attempts. The first version passed the visible band's height as the
   virtual full height, which does not move the composition up - it redefines
   the field of view as covering only the band, and everything in the room comes
   out at 47% of the size it was. What is wanted is much smaller: the same
   camera, the same scale, the image slid up by half the difference between what
   the tray covers and what the bar covers, so the composition is centred in the
   gap the player can actually see rather than in the canvas.

   Re-measured on every open rather than stored, because the tray's height is a
   function of the font and the safe-area inset and neither is knowable from
   here.

   AND MEASURED WHEN THE TRAY IS ON SCREEN. The second attempt was worse than
   wrong, it was invisible: `resizeStation()` was called while #shop still
   carried `.hidden`, so every `getBoundingClientRect` returned zero, the guard
   below fired, and the whole thing was a no-op that had been shipping for an
   afternoon while a hand-tuned camera angle quietly did the job instead. It was
   found by deliberately deleting the call and watching the test that guards it
   pass anyway - which is rule 11 catching a construct that could not fail. */
/* Re-frame only if the band has actually moved.

   Called after anything that can change the tray's height. The card reserves
