/* Terrain rendering.

   Every visible block used to be its own Group of Meshes, and because the
   per-block shade jitter is continuous, almost every one got its own material
   and therefore its own draw call. Measured on the live game: 80 draw calls at
   the surface, 207 underground, against a mobile guideline of about 50.

   Now the terrain is drawn with InstancedMesh, pooled by block id. Per-instance
   matrices carry the position and rotation jitter and per-instance colours carry
   the shade, so the world looks the same while collapsing into a handful of
   draws.

   The one exception is the block currently being drilled. It stays a real Group
   built by makeBlock() exactly as before, because the dig animation scales it,
   jitters it and parents crack decals to it - and there is only ever one at a
   time. That keeps every line of the feel code untouched and still gets
   essentially all of the win. */

   same numbers, and two copies of that fact is how the void ended up on screen
   in the first place (rule 10). */
/* ---------- and a horizontal axis, which it did not have ----------

   The window streamed ROWS around the ship and then walked the full width on
   every rebuild, with every pool allocated at `WINDOW_ROWS * W`. That is fine
   at thirteen columns and is the thing that stops the world being wider:
   measured, at sixty-one columns the instance buffers go from 2.3 MB to
   10.6 MB and every rebuild touches five times the cells, for ground that is
   nowhere near the camera.

   The frame shows about eight columns at this framing, so a window of
   twenty-one is comfortably wider than anything on screen and still a fifth of
   a wide world. The same argument as the rows: the window must exceed the
   frame or terrain pops in at the edges as the camera moves. */

   Two things, both free. A QUARTER-TURN SNAP - 0, 90, 180 or 270 about Z -

   quarter turn leaves a cube's normals and UVs exactly where they were, so the
   displacement shader and the normal map still line up. And a SCALE WOBBLE of
   about a tenth, which stops neighbouring cells sharing an edge and gives the
   wall a broken profile.
