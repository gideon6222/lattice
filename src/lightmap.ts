/* The grid the solver works on, and the bridge from it to every shader.

   The solved field is uploaded as a small texture and sampled by world
   position, which is what makes the lighting continuous rather than blocky:
   the grid is one texel per cell, but LinearFilter interpolates between them,
   so light fades across a rock face instead of stepping at its edges.

   The texture is tiny - 15 by 36 texels, 2 KB - and re-uploaded at most once a
   frame. It is not a cost worth thinking about; the cost worth thinking about
   was the solve, and that only runs when the ship changes cell or the terrain
   changes shape.

   What the shader does with it is deliberately narrow: it multiplies the light
   three has already computed, and it is clamped to at most 1. It cannot make
   anything brighter than it was. Every lighting value in feel.ts was calibrated
   by eye against the old renderer and stays valid; this only takes light away
   from places the lamp cannot reach. */

   At one texel per cell, LinearFilter interpolates between the CENTRES of
   neighbouring cells - so every boundary in the lighting is a soft ramp a full
   cell wide, and a single rock face can be half lit with a rounded edge running
   across it. What the player sees is the shape of the light grid rather than
   the shape of the rock. Switching to NearestFilter proves it instantly: the
   blobs vanish and are replaced by hard rectangles.

   Neither is right. What is right is a finer grid holding the SAME per-cell
   values: each cell fills a 3x3 block, so bilinear only ever interpolates
   across the one-texel seam at a cell boundary. The transition is a third of a
   cell instead of a whole one - too tight to read as a blob, too soft to read
   as a step - and it sits exactly on the cell edge, which is where the rock's
   own edges are.

   It costs nothing worth measuring. The solve is unchanged and still per cell;
   this is a fill loop and a 19 KB upload instead of a 2 KB one. */

/* ---------- light in the air ----------

   The half of "light fills the tunnel" that lighting a surface cannot do.

   A dug cell contains nothing. There is no geometry in it to light, so however
   good the propagated field is, what the player sees down an open shaft is
   whatever plane happens to be behind it - and the tunnel reads as an empty
   slot rather than as a space with light in it.

   This is one additive quad across the frame, sampling the OPEN channel of the
   same texture. Where the solver says a cell is open and reached, it adds a
   warm glow; on rock it adds nothing, because the channel is zero there. It
   sits behind the terrain and depth-tests against it, so the two agree twice
   over about where a tunnel is.

   One draw call and a trivial fragment. The cost is fill rate, and fill rate
   is the one thing this phone has in abundance. */
/* IN FRONT of the terrain, not behind it.

   Behind was the obvious place - the haze belongs in the empty volume of the
   tunnel, and depth-testing against the rock meant it could only ever show
   through a hole. What that missed is that a rock face is not flat: the
   displacement shader pushes vertices up to a fifth of a cell forward, so the
   walls of a tunnel bulge INTO it, and every one of those bulges drew over the
   haze as an angular chip of lit rock floating in the fog.

   In front, none of that can happen, and nothing is lost: the open channel is
   zero on rock, so the quad adds nothing there anyway. The half-texel of
   bilinear bleed at the edge of a tunnel is a bonus - light spilling onto the
   lip of the wall, which is what it should do.

   That puts it forward of the ship's old z, so the ship moved forward too. See
   SHIP_Z in ship.ts: the ship has to stay in front of its own light or the
   additive quad washes the hull flat. */
