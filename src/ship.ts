/* The drill ship.

   Small on purpose. With 18 rows framed it occupies maybe thirty pixels, so
   "detail" here means silhouette rather than surface: swept fins read at that
   size, panel lines do not.

   Playtest: *"change the ship to look less bubbly and cartoonish."* Three
   things were doing that, and none of them was the amount of detail:

   - **A sphere for a canopy.** A sphere is the one shape with no orientation
     and no facets, so it reads as a bubble at any size. It is a faceted wedge
     now, which is the single biggest change in here.
   - **Bright saturated cyan.** Toy colours read as a toy. The livery is
     gunmetal and worn ochre, with the cyan cut back to running lights, where
     it earns its place by making the hull legible in the dark.
   - **Everything was a cylinder.** Six and eight-sided prisms with rounded
     silhouettes and no hard corners. There are chamfered blocks, exposed
     struts and a heavy drill collar now - shapes that catch a light on one
     face and not the next.

   Metal is MeshStandardMaterial, for the same reason the rock is: metalness
   and roughness are what separate steel from painted plastic, and Lambert has
   neither. */

export const player = new THREE.Group();

/* Worn, not showroom. High metalness with middling roughness is machined metal
   that has been down a hole; low roughness would be chrome and would read as
   toy plastic again from the other direction. */
/* Rougher and less metallic than it was, and the reason is the same one that
   took the key light down: at metalness 0.55 and roughness 0.56 a single close
   light put the entire face inside one specular highlight and the hull
   rendered white. Roughness spreads that energy out instead of concentrating
   it, which is what lets a dark colour actually read as dark. */
/* ---------- the palette ----------

   Six materials, and between them they are the whole "advanced but ancient"
   read. The old set was built around brass, because a near-black hull needed
   a mid-value appendage to be visible at thirty pixels. This one solves that
   in the hull itself: the body is PALE, so it separates from dark rock on
   value alone, and the accent can then be a single alien light rather than a
   second metal.

   Playtest, 2026-09-13: *"I dont really like the look of the ship. Can you see
   if you can make it look more like advanced technology that has been sitting
   for thousands of years, so it is advanced but also old looking."*

   That replaces the W1 direction, which was *"redesign the ship to look more
   steam punk and unique"* - a boiler, a raked stack, a spoked flywheel, brass
   over everything. Standing rule 9: when he restates from scratch instead of
   refining, the model is wrong rather than the tuning, so none of that is
   kept. It also closes a hole in the fiction. The Anchors, the sealed halls
   and the Vault are all the work of somebody advanced who is long gone; a
   brass boiler belonged to no one in this world. A driller flying recovered
   Lattice gear does.

   The research (plans/lattice/REFERENCE.md - Sheikah tech, Subnautica's
   Precursor work, the Vex) converges on six signifiers, and each one below is
   one of them:

     ONE SEALED SILHOUETTE. No stack, no wheel, no exposed rod. Ancient
     advanced tech has no moving parts on the outside; the moment something
     protrudes and turns, the read is Victorian machine.
     LARGE FLAT FACETS, NO RIVETS. Few, big planes. The rivets are gone - a
     rivet is a fastening you can see, which is exactly the thing this
     civilization would not show you.
     ONE ALIEN EMISSIVE, ALONG SEAMS. Not amber, and not on gauges: gauges
     are instruments for a pilot, and a seam that glows is the object itself
     being powered. Teal, because that is what an Anchor does when it lights,
     and the ship and the Lattice should read as one hand.
     MATTE, STONE-LIKE. Low metalness and high roughness. Polished metal
     reads as new whatever color it is.
     ONE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY. A single break in an otherwise regular object
     reads as damage; a generally messy object reads as clutter.
     WEAR AS DEAD LIGHT, NOT RUST. One seam has gone out. Rust is the
     steampunk word for age; a panel that used to be lit and is not is the
     ancient-advanced one.

   And the constraint that governed the old hull governs this one: it is about
   thirty pixels at play scale, so this is a silhouette and a value, and every
   part below is either one or the other. */

/* The core. A six-sided prism lying across the ship with a flat facet up, so
