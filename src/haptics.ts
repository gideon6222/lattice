/* Haptics.

   `POLISH.md`: every action fires visual, audio, camera and haptic feedback
   together, and any one of them alone reads as cheap. This game had three of
   the four and not one `navigator.vibrate` call anywhere, for six versions.

   Everything here is deliberately tiny and deliberately defensive:

   - **Android Chrome supports it and iOS Safari does not**, silently. There is
     no feature to apologise for, so an absent API is simply a no-op.
   - **A vibrate call inside a page that has never been tapped throws** in some
     builds, and a page that is hidden ignores it. Both are wrapped.
   - **Durations are short.** The literature puts a tap at 10 to 20 ms; past
     about 60 ms a phone buzzes rather than taps, which reads as a notification
     rather than as the game. The longest thing here is the quake at 90 ms and
     it is the only event that is allowed to feel like an interruption, because
     it is one.
   - **It is off until it is on.** Stored beside the audio settings, defaulting
     ON, because a phone game that never buzzes when you break something is the
     thing being fixed - but the switch is real and it persists. */
