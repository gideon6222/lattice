/* ---------- the d-pad, and the forgiveness in it ----------

   `mechanics/FOUNDATIONS.md` principle 3: forgiveness is invisible and is most
   of "feel". Round ten's research ranked input BUFFERING first for a game at
   this stage, and measuring it here said it was the wrong forgiveness: the
   only press this game refuses on a timescale a buffer could bridge is
   ordnance with an empty meter, and `CHARGE_SECONDS` is 42 seconds a point, so
   a 150 ms window bridges nothing. The forgiveness that was actually missing
   was one step upstream, in who owns the pointer.

   The keys are 60 px on a 5 px grid, which is about 10 mm on his phone against
   a thumb nearer 18 mm. They used to bind `pointerleave` to a release, so:

     A THUMB THAT DRIFTS STOPPED THE SHIP. Three pixels into the gutter ended
     a dig, silently, in the middle of the one action this game is about. A
     player does not report that as "the key released", they report it as the
     controls feeling wrong, which is exactly what principle 3 predicts.
     A SLIDE BETWEEN KEYS DEAD-ENDED. `pointerleave` fired on the key the
     thumb left and `pointerdown` never fired on the key it reached, because
     the pointer was already down. So the ship simply stopped.

   `setPointerCapture` fixes both and is the whole change. A press owns the
   pointer until it is lifted, which suppresses the boundary events outright,
   and a move is hit-tested against the grid so the thumb can slide from one
   key to another and hand the ship over. Drifting OFF the pad entirely keeps
   the last direction: the press is still live, and guessing that the player
   meant to stop is the same mistake `pointerleave` was making. */
