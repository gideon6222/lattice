# The Lattice — the plan

Round four, written 2026-09-10 against v0.24.0. **The plan, not a history.** Rewrite in place
as things land; the changelog is where the record goes. Rounds one to three are in the
appendix at the bottom, shipped.

This file was `DESIGN.md` until 2026-09-09. It is `PLAN.md` because that is the name
`INDEX.md` tells a resuming session to open.

## Summary

**Fantasy:** a contracted driller working the Verdax Drift, cutting a world apart from the
inside to buy his way out of it.
**Loop:** dive, cut, fill the hold, climb out before the world takes it back, sell, buy one
rung, go deeper.
**Engine:** web, three.js. Decided 2026-09-10 on measurement rather than habit: the game runs
well on the S26 Ultra installed as a PWA, the only platform limit it has met is 400x larger
than it needs, and a Godot rewrite is 12,716 lines of working game thrown away for a benefit
you have said you do not want yet.
**Reference:** none. Original. Genre neighbours are Motherload, SteamWorld Dig 1 and 2, Dome
Keeper and Mr. Driller, researched 2026-09-10 and cited where a mechanism is borrowed.
**New technique:** per-face axis-selected UV projection on the rock (a right-sized triplanar).
Fixes a real bug and is the first thing that will make caverns look like stone.
**What you keep:** one relic per planet, the five Jump Drive components, and the record book.

### The three faults, measured

Everything below is derived from the shipped game, through the same bundle the golden tests
use. The probes are in the milestone list so they become permanent.

**Fault 1 — everything at stake is the ship.** Fuel, heat, hull and tremors all threaten one
object, and the worst outcome is a tow that costs a percentage of one haul. There is nothing
you can lose that you are not holding. Dome Keeper's designer names this exactly: depth is
worth something when it is dangerous to a system you are *not* touching. The Lattice has no
second system. This is why *"it feels free"* survived a reprice: the price was never the
problem, the absence of a second thing to lose was.

**Fault 2 — the first sale defuses the first hour.** Measured, planet 0, no upgrades:

| Band | Ore cells per 1,000 | Value per kg | One 60 kg hold |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5–20 m | 57 | 11.1 | 666 cr |
| 20–35 m | 45 | 20.4 | 1,223 cr |
| 35–50 m | 45 | 36.0 | 2,161 cr |
| 50–70 m | 41 | 78.4 | 4,703 cr |
| 70–85 m | 27 | 115.3 | 6,916 cr |
| 85–110 m | 55 | 162.8 | 9,770 cr |

That table is an upper bound: it prices a hold of pure ore. **M1 has since measured the real
thing** and it is worse rather than better — a first run pays 114 to 311 credits because most
of what you cut is in the way rather than worth money, and yet *every ladder in the shop is
started inside the first four to sixteen minutes whatever style you play*. The M1 section in
`NOTES.md` has the table.

Against that, the first rung of every ladder: Thrusters 100, Cargo 110, Drill 130, Scanner
140, Fuel Tank 480, Cooling 1,000. **The first hold you ever sell buys four upgrades**, and
the two that answer the game's two pressures cost less than a second hold. There is no point
in the opening where you want something you cannot have, which is the whole of *"I can afford
upgrades pretty early on for fuel and cooling so neither is a risk."*

**Fault 3 — half the game is behind a wall you have never reached.** Planet 0's core is at
**110 m**. Heat starts at 70, tremors at 85. Across five sessions every note you have written
has been about the first sixty metres and the surface. So the chart, the traits, the Jump
Drive, the Heart, the crossing and the twelve palettes — everything built in rounds one to
three — sits behind one 110 m dive that has never happened. It is not undiscovered content,
it is unplayed content, and the fix is not to build more of it.

### What this round does about them

1. **A second system: the Claim.** Something at the surface that depth threatens and the ship
   cannot protect. Section below.
2. **An economy measured rather than assumed**, with a probe that reports the run at which
   each upgrade is bought and a test that fails when the opening goes free again.
3. **The first world compressed** so heat, tremors, a core break, the chart and a crossing all
   happen in the first session, and the hazard depths scale per world instead of sitting on
   global constants.
4. **An art pass that starts with a bug**: the rock's texture projection is wrong on every
   face that is not facing the camera, which is every floor, ceiling and cavern wall.
5. **The things POLISH.md asks for that this game has never had**: haptics, a run debrief, a
   record book.

### Your asks, expanded

Numbered because you asked for the whole game overhauled, and these are the standing ones
that this round finally answers rather than works around.

1. *"it feels free"* / *"there isn't really a risk or reward yet"* → the Claim, plus a
   measured opening. Fault 1 and 2.
2. *"think about a larger point to the game, or secondary objective"* → the record book and
   the Claim's ledger, on top of the relics and the drive that already exist.
3. *"make the graphics look more realistic and detailed, more gritty"* → the UV fix, then the
   imported mineral surfaces, then a second normal-mapped surface on the ship.
4. *"make it so upgrades show visual changes on the ship"* → extended to the Claim, which
   visibly grows and visibly breaks.
5. *"use pre-made assets wherever you can"* → the asset table below, with the misses named.
6. *"add a log to see how fast things drain and whether the cost is worth the benefit"* → the
   telemetry panel gets the two questions it cannot currently answer: what a run was worth per
   minute, and which upgrade paid for itself.
7. *"is there a way to see how far I have gone"* (implied by the depth marker you asked for)
   → the record book, kept across worlds.

### My additions, marked as mine

- **The core breach becomes an escape.** Breaking a core currently opens a menu. It should
  start the world coming apart around you with the shaft collapsing behind you, and the chart
  should open once you are out. The best moment in the game is currently a dialog box.
- **Ore has a shape on the ground.** Fault 2's real cause is that every kilo is the same
  decision. Heavy-and-cheap versus light-and-dear only matters when the hold is nearly full,
  so the hold should fill sooner and the manifest should let you dump a mineral by name.
- **A reason to come back tomorrow**: the Drift's worlds are seeded from a daily seed as well
  as the run seed, so the chart's offer changes day to day.

## Systems

### 1. The Claim — the second thing you can lose

**The idea in one line.** You do not own the ship, you own a claim on the surface: a
refinery, a fuel derrick and a store shed standing beside the pad. Cutting the world apart
shakes the ground it stands on.

**Why this and not another hazard.** Every pressure in the game today points at the ship, so
every one of them is answered by the same reflex, which is to fly up. A system you are not
touching is the mechanism the best game in this genre uses to stop mining being a treadmill,
and it is the missing half of *"it feels free"*. It also gives credits a second place to go,
which matters because a purely geometric upgrade ladder makes every amount you earn
irrelevant to the amount before it.

**State it owns** (`src/sim/claim.ts`, saved per world, cleared on a core break):

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `strain` | 0–1, how far the world has been pushed. Rises with cells removed below the stability line |
| `integrity` | 0–100 on each of three structures: refinery, derrick, shed |
| `stored` | ore left in the shed rather than sold, at a better price later |

**Rules.**

- **Strain rises from your own digging, below the stability line only.** Per cell removed,
  scaled by how far below the line it is. Dwelling costs nothing on its own — heat already
  charges for that, and two systems charging for the same verb is one system.
- **Strain is spent, not survived.** At 1.0 a surface quake fires: each structure rolls
  against its own exposure and takes damage, strain drops to 0.35, and the world is a little
  richer afterwards (`rich` rises 4%). The world is being broken open, and that is worth
  something. *This is the bet: a shaken world pays more.*
- **Damage is a discount, never a wall.** A damaged refinery pays less per kilo. A damaged
  derrick refuels slower. A damaged shed loses a fraction of what is stored. None of them
  stops a run, and none of them can make a save unwinnable, per `CRAFT.md`.
- **Repair costs credits and one deep material.** The material for repairing the refinery is
  found below the stability line, so the thing that fixes the surface is only found in the
  place that breaks it. `CRAFT.md`: gate an upgrade behind a place, not a price.
- **The shed is the greed dial you hold yourself.** Store ore instead of selling and it is
  worth 1.4x at the end of the world, if the shed is still standing when you break the core.

**Numbers, first pass, to be replaced by whatever the probe says.** Strain per cell at the
line 0.004, doubling by the core; quake at 1.0; refinery damage 12–30; refinery payout
penalty 0.35 x damage fraction; repair 900 cr plus 4 units of the deep material; shed
multiplier 1.4 and shed loss 20% of stored per quake at full damage.

**The test.** `test_claim`: strain is monotonic in cells removed and zero above the line; a
quake never reduces payout below 0.5x; the repair material's generation depth is below the
stability line at every leg; and the invariance test `CRAFT.md` asks for — same world, same
digging, different starting bank, same strain.

**How it is shown.** The Claim is geometry on the pad you fly past every time you surface, and
it is the only place the gauge lives. No new HUD element: `CRAFT.md` says a HUD is a claim
about what the player should think about, and this is a thing you should think about when you
are up, not while you are cutting. A quake is a shot: the camera shakes at the surface, dust
comes off the structures, and one of them is visibly bent afterwards.

---

### 2. The economy, measured

**The fault, restated in one number.** The first hold you sell pays 1,223 credits. The first
rung of Thrusters, Cargo, Drill and Scanner together cost 480.

**The rebuild.**

- **Price every pressure-answering upgrade against the depth where its pressure begins**, not
  against the first haul. Fuel Tank and Cooling Rig rung 1 land at roughly three holds from
  the band where fuel and heat first bite, not one.
- **Flatten the multiplier and lengthen the ladder.** A 2.0x step means the last rung costs
  more than the first eight together, which is why maxing is 245,000 credits and nobody will
  ever see it. 1.55x is already recorded here as hyper-inflationary. Target 1.35–1.45 with
  more rungs and a real top.
- **Give credits a sink that is not a rung**: Claim repair, shed storage, and transit fuel.
- **The rule the shop obeys**: everything unlocked, plus exactly one teaser, the shallowest
  thing still out of reach. Already the rule, now asserted at every leg rather than at one.

**The tool, and this is the milestone that matters.** `scripts/econ.mjs`: run a scripted
player through the pure layer — dive to the best band reachable, fill, climb, sell, buy the
best affordable rung, repeat — and report the run number and the wall-clock minute at which
each upgrade is bought, for three play styles (cautious, greedy, optimal). `CRAFT.md`:
measure a progression by simulating play, never by dividing a late price by early income.

**The test.** `test_econ`: the first sale buys at most one rung; Fuel Tank and Cooling are not
affordable before 60% of the depth where their pressure starts; every upgrade is bought by
leg 6 under the optimal style; and the spread between cautious and greedy is at least 25%,
because when every style scores the same, the finding is that the game has no decision in it.

---

### 3. The first world, compressed

**The fault.** Planet 0's core is at 110 m with heat at 70 and tremors at 85, and five
sessions of play have never gone past about 78 m. Everything from the chart onward is
unplayed rather than unbuilt.

**The change.** The three thresholds stop being global constants and become functions of the
leg, anchored to that world's core:

| | Now | Proposed leg 0 | Relation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | 110 m | 58 m | `core(leg) = 58 + 28 * leg` |
| Heat line | 70 m | 32 m | `heat = round(0.55 * core)` |
| Tremor line | 85 m | 44 m | `tremor = round(0.76 * core)` |

So the first world teaches heat at 32 m, teaches tremors at 44 m, and ends at 58 m — a core
break, a chart, a crossing and a trait inside the first session. Leg 1's core is at 86 m, and
by leg 4 the numbers are where they are today.

**The invariant survives, as a relation instead of a constant.** `GRANITE_TO_SCORIA ===
HEAT_DEPTH` becomes `graniteToScoria(leg) === heatDepth(leg)`, and the test asserts it at
every leg rather than at one. The four things that land on the same metre still land on the
same metre.

**Existing saves.** The depths are written into the save the first time a world is entered, so
the world you are standing on keeps the numbers it was generated with. A save cannot end up
with its ship below a core that moved.

---

### 4. Breaking the core becomes the best moment instead of a dialog

Today: the core breaks, a modal opens, you pick the next world. The most cinematic beat in the
game is a box with a button.

**The breach.** The core cracks, and the world starts coming apart from the bottom up:

1. A hard shake, the lamp cuts to emergency red, and the ambient goes to ember.
2. **Ninety seconds on the clock**, shown as the shaft filling from below rather than as a
   number. Tremors every 6–9 s instead of every 27.
3. Collapse propagates upward through dug cells behind you, so the route you cut is the route
   that closes. The pathfinder guarantee stays: `CRAFT.md` says never let a hazard take the
   run, so the collapse can never seal the last open route to the surface, and there is a test.
4. Reach the pad and the transit plays as it does now, with the world breaking apart behind
   you rather than receding intact.
5. Fail to reach it and you are towed for the usual cut — you lose the hold, not the run, and
   the world still breaks.

**Why it earns its cost.** It is one clock, reusing the tremor system, the collapse system,
the tow and the transit, and it converts the moment the game is named after into something you
survive. It also makes the shed a real decision: everything stored is sold at the breach.

---

### 5. The hold becomes a decision

`CRAFT.md`: a weight cap is what turns "which is worth more" into a decision — but only in the
minutes when it binds. Today the hold is 60 kg and the ore that fills it is chosen for you by
what you happened to fly through.

- **Dump by mineral from the manifest.** One tap on a row jettisons that mineral. It is the
  action the manifest has been describing for four versions without offering.
- **Widen the weight spread** so heavy-and-cheap genuinely competes with light-and-dear. Keep
  the value spread on a premium under 2x per the recorded measurement, and put the variety in
  weight instead.
- **The hold fills sooner and the climb is where you pay for it**, which is Motherload's
  weight-versus-fuel tradeoff, the one mechanism in that game everybody remembers.

---

### 6. Everything POLISH.md asks for that this game has never had

- **Haptics.** There is not one `navigator.vibrate` call in the repo. Android Chrome supports
  it, it is three lines behind a settings toggle, and `POLISH.md` requires every action to
  fire visual, audio, camera and haptic together. Cutting a block, a strike, a quake, a
  purchase, a tow.
- **A run debrief.** A run currently ends by folding numbers into a total. It should show what
  the run paid, the depth reached against the record, what was left on the ground, and the one
  thing you were closest to affording — `POLISH.md`'s "a run that ended one decision short".
- **A record book.** Deepest metre, best haul, fastest core, worlds broken, relics held,
  components carried. A collection that does not decay, kept across worlds, reachable from the
  pause screen beside the patch notes.
- **The tremor roll gets seeded.** `planCollapse()` takes `rand: () => number = Math.random`
  and the shipping game takes the default, so the one event a replay cannot reproduce is the
  one that decides whether the way out is open. It moves onto the world's seeded stream.

---

## Presentation

### The rock, starting with a bug

`src/materials.ts:198` sets `vec2 rockUv = wpos.xy` for **every face of every cell**. That is
correct only for faces pointing at the camera. A tunnel floor or ceiling has its extent in X
and Z and is being sampled with (x, y), so one whole axis of texture variation collapses and
the surface reads as a flat band rather than stone. Every horizontal tunnel, every cavern
floor and every ledge underside in the game is currently smeared.

**The fix is the round's new technique**: pick the projection plane per face in the vertex
shader from the box's own normal — `abs(normal)` decides between `wpos.xy`, `wpos.zy` and
`wpos.xz`. This is triplanar mapping's right-sized form for this geometry: the terrain is a
flat-shaded box with hard 90-degree edges, so there is no seam for a three-way blend to hide,
and a full blend would triple the texture fetches for nothing. Cost: 0 KB of bundle, 0 draw
calls, a handful of scalar compares at vertex frequency. Sources are in the research note;
the canonical ones are GPU Gems 3 chapter 1 and Ben Golus on triplanar normal mapping.

Filmed on a horizontal tunnel and a cavern before and after, because a texture artefact under
a moving lamp does not show in a still.

### The rest of the art pass

- **More mineral surfaces**, normal and roughness only, never colour, so twelve palettes keep
  deciding colour. Table below.
- **A normal map on the hull.** The ship is the object on screen for the entire game at full
  size, and it is the one large surface with no relief on it. `CRAFT.md`: "cartoony" means
  under-lit and under-textured, and a normal map on the largest surface does more than a model
  swap.
- **The Claim as geometry**, built from imported industrial props rather than modelled, since
  it stands at full size on screen every time you surface and it is exactly what the assets
  rule is for.
- **The breach as a grade**: ember ambient, red lamp, dust density up, the vignette closing.
  One palette shift driven by one number, not five separate effects.

---

---

## Assets

Hunted 2026-09-10 against `ASSETS.md`. The rule is a measurement, not a preference: import
what the player reads at its real size, model in code what is judged on silhouette at thirty
pixels. Everything below is CC0 or OFL unless stated, and every import is **normal and
roughness only, never a colour map**, because twelve palettes keep deciding colour.

### The budget decision that comes first

There is **no glTF loader in the bundle today** — the ship, the pad and every prop are coded.
The first model import therefore costs `GLTFLoader` once, roughly 15 to 20 KB minified and
gzipped, before a single model's bytes. Today's totals: 747.2 KB overall, and the `index`
chunk is already at 151.1 KB against a 144.4 KB budget, drifting +4.61%.

**So the loader and the props are lazy-loaded, not bundled.** They are surface geometry, and
the surface is not the first thing on screen: the game is interactive before the pad's
detail arrives, the loader lands in its own chunk, and the size guard gets a new budget line
for it rather than a raised one on `index`. If that proves awkward, the fallback is to keep
the Claim coded and spend the import budget only on textures, which cost no loader at all.

### Surfaces — the textures, which need no loader

| Need | Source | Id | Licence | Fetch | Into |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Granite | ambientCG | `Granite002A` | CC0 | `python assets.py get ambientcg Granite002A --res 1K --maps NormalGL,Roughness` | `src/textures/` |
| Basalt, and obsidian by reuse | ambientCG | `Rock035` | CC0 | `python assets.py get ambientcg Rock035 --res 1K --maps NormalGL,Roughness` | `src/textures/` |
| Ice | ambientCG | `Snow006` | CC0 | `python assets.py get ambientcg Snow006 --res 1K --maps NormalGL,Roughness` | `src/textures/` |
| Sandstone | ambientCG | `Rock029` | CC0 | `python assets.py get ambientcg Rock029 --res 1K --maps NormalGL,Roughness` | `src/textures/` |
| Marble | Poly Haven | `marble_cliff_05` | CC0 | `python assets.py get polyhaven marble_cliff_05 --res 1k` | `src/textures/` |
| Crystal, and salt by reuse | ambientCG | `Onyx006` | CC0 | `python assets.py get ambientcg Onyx006 --res 1K --maps NormalGL,Roughness` | `src/textures/` |

Each becomes a WebP pair and a palette-driven material variant through the existing
`src/materials.ts` path. No new code path, no loader, and they are the reason the UV fix goes
first: a better normal map projected wrong is still smeared.

### Props and the ship

| Need | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **The drill ship** | **Stays coded.** Nothing CC0 is a purpose-built mining vessel at a sane size, and this is the hero object on screen for the whole game. The search is the answer, not a redirection |
| **The landing pad and the Claim** | Import. On screen at full size every time you surface, which is exactly what the rule is for. Kenney `factory-kit` (crates, pipes, catwalks), `space-station-kit` (antennae, panels, lights), `modular-space-kit` (platform tiles) |
| **Drill tier, visibly** | PolyPizza `8uBbH7Dvmb`, Kay Lousberg's Drill, CC0, 1,198 tris, as the nose attachment that changes per tier |
| **Thruster and plating tiers** | Kenney `space-kit` parts, **only if** the zip turns out to contain glTF. It is an unversioned Kenney pack, which historically means OBJ or FBX, and nothing here converts those |

**Verify before relying on any of them**: only the versioned zips (`factory-kit_3.0`,
`city-kit-industrial_2.0`, `modular-space-kit_1.0`) are likely to be current-format re-exports.
The milestone opens the zip and looks before the plan promises anything.

**This shortlist is provisional, and here is why.** The hunt found that
`gamedev-notes/scripts/assets.py` could not search Kenney at all: its listing regex matched
only double-quoted links, and Kenney's pages emit single quotes — measured at 55 single-quoted
against 6 double-quoted on one category page, so about a tenth of the library was visible and
the rest was reported as absent. It is fixed now, and the very first re-run surfaced
**`modular-cave-kit`**, which nothing in the original shortlist knew existed and which is the
most obviously relevant pack in the library to a game made of caves. M2 re-runs the search
before importing anything.

Every imported mesh has its baked atlas stripped at load and a `MeshStandardMaterial` coloured
from the palette assigned instead, roughness about 0.8 and metallic 0 unless the piece is meant
to read as bare metal. That keeps a Kenney crate and the coded ship under one lighting model.

### Interface

| Need | Source | Id | Licence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HUD frames, gauge and bar plates | Kenney | `ui-pack-sci-fi` | CC0 | 768 KB zip, a handful of sprites reach `dist/` |
| Ten icons | Lucide | `fuel`, `flame`, `package`, `coins`, `drill`, `zap`, `bomb`, `radar`, `anchor`, `rocket` | ISC | One stroke family, tinted by `currentColor`, so the palette still decides. There is no tow-truck glyph, `anchor` is the tow |
| Display face | Google Fonts | `Orbitron` 700/900 | OFL-1.1 | Wide, geometric, industrial |
| Numerals | Google Fonts | `Share Tech Mono` 400 | OFL-1.1 | A readout face for the gauges, about 20 KB |

Both faces join the existing two in the Workbox precache glob, or an installed app falls back
to a system face offline.

### Sound

Eight CC0 sounds from Freesound, fetched as HQ OGG previews: drilling loop `634322`, rock
break `524312`, ore pickup `646673`, thruster loop `347576`, hull damage `682736`, tremor
rumble `483287`, purchase click `839832`, alarm `584287`.

These replace the synthesised **effects**, where a produced sample is simply better. **The
music stays synthesised**, and this is now a measured answer rather than an inherited one: the
scout searched OpenGameArt and Freesound for a bed, a tension layer and a danger layer at one
tempo and key, and no CC0 library indexes stems as a matched set. The score mixes live by
depth, danger and zone off one scheduler, and nothing available can do that.

### The misses, plainly

- No distinct CC0 basalt, obsidian or salt scan. Handled by reusing one normal map and
  separating them in code by roughness and palette.
- No CC0 drill ship worth importing. The ship stays code.
- No CC0 layered music stems anywhere searched. The score stays code.
- `assets/CREDITS.md` does not exist in this repo yet, and the four textures already in
  `src/textures/` are not recorded anywhere. `POLISH.md` requires it. M7 writes it and
  backfills those four.

## Tests and tools

| Layer | What is added |
|---|---|
| Probes | `scripts/econ.mjs` (three play styles, run-by-run purchase report), `scripts/claim.mjs` (strain per style over a world) |
| Golden | Claim strain and quake sequence for a fixed seed; the per-leg threshold table |
| Design | `test_econ` and `test_claim` above; the per-leg `granite === heat` relation at every leg |
| Boundary | `test/sim-boundary.test.mjs` already guards `src/sim`; `claim.ts` goes inside it |
| Smoke | The breach: core break, clock, collapse behind, reach the pad, chart opens. And the tow path out of a failed breach |
| Filmstrip | New scenarios `breach`, `quake`, `cavern` (the UV fix), `debrief` |
| Phone | The six questions in `TESTING.md` after the breach lands, because it is the one new thing that is all motion |

---

## Polish budget

`POLISH.md` lines this round pays for, and where:

- First sixty seconds, a win in the first minute → M3 (economy) and M5 (compressed world).
- Haptics on every action → M8.
- Ambient motion in the idle state → the Claim's structures, M2.
- The shop is a place with the real object in it → already true; the Claim extends it, M2.
- A run that ended one decision short → the debrief, M8.
- A meta-goal that does not decay → the record book, M8.
- Every screen looked at as a picture at the phone's aspect → M9, before the ship.

---

## Milestones

### Phase 1: the faults

- [x] **M1 — Measure before changing anything.** `scripts/econ.mjs` and the three play styles,
      reporting the run at which each upgrade is bought. No behaviour change. The report goes
      in `NOTES.md` and is the baseline every later number is argued against.
      **Done 2026-09-10.** Three findings the plan did not have: the hold is 11-14% full when
      a run ends so the weight cap has never once bound, every ladder is started inside four
      to sixteen minutes at every style, and depth is gated by behaviour rather than by time
      (a greedy player is at 109 m by minute seven).
- [x] **M2 — The Claim, as a place.** `src/sim/claim.ts`, strain, quakes, three structures,
      repair, the shed. `test_claim`, the strain golden, a filmed quake. The geometry comes
      with the first model import this repo has ever done, so this milestone also opens the
      Kenney zips to check they contain glTF at all, puts `GLTFLoader` and the props in a
      lazy chunk rather than in `index`, and adds a budget line for that chunk. If the zips
      turn out to be OBJ or FBX, the Claim is coded and the milestone still lands.
- [x] **M3 — The economy rebuilt on M1's numbers.** New curve, pressure-priced rungs, credits
      sink. `test_econ`. The probe report before and after, in `NOTES.md`.
- [x] **M4 — The hold as a decision.** Dump by mineral, widened weight spread, manifest tap.
      Promoted by M1 from a refinement to a missing mechanic: a cap that never binds is not a
      decision, and Cargo Hold is currently the first thing every style buys.
- [x] **M5 — The first world compressed.** Per-leg thresholds, save migration, the invariant as
      a relation asserted at every leg.
- [x] **M6 — The breach.** The clock, the collapse behind you, the tow path, the chart after.
      Filmed. This is the one to send a video of.

### Phase 2: the look

- [x] **M7 — The UV fix and the mineral surfaces.** The new technique, then the imported
      normal and roughness pairs, then the hull normal. Filmed on a cavern, before and after.
      Writes `assets/CREDITS.md`, which this repo has never had, and backfills the four
      textures already in `src/textures/` that are recorded nowhere.

      **Done 2026-09-10, and this box carried `- [~]` until 2026-09-18 saying the
      surfaces were not in.** They landed the same day the blocker was written down,
      and the prose under the box was never updated. `- [~]` is not a legal marker
      (INDEX.md rule 3b): `progress.ps1` and `doctor.ps1` both count it as done, so
      for eight days this read as finished to every count and as owed to every
      reader, which is the worst of both. Partial progress belongs in prose like this,
      never in the box.

      **What landed, against what was asked:** the UV fix is the triplanar projection
      at `src/materials.ts:245` picking the plane per face off `abs(normal)`.
      `assets/CREDITS.md` exists and is backfilled. The surfaces are THREE pairs and
      not six, deliberately - `Ground110` for dirt, `Gravel043` for the stone band,
      and granite, scoria and basalt keep `Rock035` (`BAND_SURFACE`,
      `src/materials.ts:321`). A surface per BAND was the design once colour was
      ruled out as the material cue, and six would have been three maps nothing
      sampled. **The hull normal was fetched, measured and dropped**: ambientCG
      `Metal038` converted to a 462-byte file with a luminance standard deviation of
      0.4, so the source had almost no relief. Dropped on the measurement rather than
      shipped as an invisible improvement.

      **The JPEG-to-WebP blocker was solved with a different tool**, Python Pillow
      rather than a fix to `sharp-cli`, which was never diagnosed and is not claimed
      fixed. Every conversion is variance-checked before it is wired in, which is what
      caught `Metal038`.
- [x] **M8 — Haptics, the debrief and the record book.** The three POLISH lines this game has
      never had, in one pass because they are all "what happens when a run ends".
- [x] **M9 — The screens as pictures.** Every screen at 460x996, the shop, the chart, the
      debrief, the record book, the pause sheet. Fix what the picture shows.

### Phase 3: what it becomes

- [x] **M10 — The daily Drift.** The chart's offer seeded by the date as well as the run, so
      there is a reason to open it tomorrow.
- [x] **M11 — Trait signatures with teeth.** Each trait changes a rule, not only the picture:
      Hollow's caverns carry light and hide long falls, Volatile's gas answers the bomb,
      Crystalline's veins pay on a chain, Searing raises the heat line, Stable pays a premium
      for a clean run.

---

## Second month

The Drift keeps generating worlds after the Heart, so the endgame is already open-ended. What
it wants next, in rough order: a second ship hull with different arithmetic rather than bigger
numbers, so the choice is a shape and not a rung; contracts that ask for a named mineral by a
named depth and pay in Claim repairs; and a wreck to find, which is somebody else's Claim,
abandoned, with their ledger still in it.

---

## Open decisions I made for you

Each is reversible, each has an alternative, and each goes into `NOTES.md` when it lands.

1. **The Claim is per world and does not travel.** The alternative is one Claim carried
   across the whole Drift, which makes the arc longer but means one bad world can sour ten.
2. **A quake makes the world richer.** The alternative is pure downside, which would make
   depth simply worse and is the thing this round is trying to fix.
3. **The breach clock is 90 seconds.** Long enough to climb 58 m at level 0 thrust with room
   for two mistakes. It is the number most likely to be wrong and it is one constant.
4. **The compressed thresholds keep today's numbers by leg 4** rather than rescaling the whole
   ladder, so nothing about the deep game changes, only when you first meet it.
5. **Web, not Godot.** Decided 2026-09-10 on the measurements in the summary.

# Round five: the Outfitter as a gas station

Written 2026-09-10 against v0.26.0, from his own design brief:

> *"like a 3d futuristic gas station. the ship parks at the gas station, it has a retro neon
> feel with the lights. anything neon should feel like it is actually coming from an object or
> light in the room, not an overlay. the shop is similar to a gas station store. there is a
> display case that is also a counter. in the display case are important and expensive
> upgrades. behind the counter on the wall are the more standard upgrades."*

He designed the room. This is how it gets built.

## What is wrong with what is there

**The plinths are a control that does nothing.** They were built to filter the shelf, the
filtering was cut in the same commit for a real reason, and four lit, labelled,
tappable-looking objects shipped anyway. `POLISH.md`: every state names a visible action. He
found it in the first minute. Two attempts to wire them back up broke three different smoke
tests, all of which were written when every case was always on the shelf - which is the signal
that the grouping is the wrong mechanism, not that the tests are wrong.

**The neon is a decal.** `MeshBasicMaterial` planes with an additive halo, at a fixed z in
front of the room. Lit rectangles, not lit fittings. His read of it is exactly right.

## The build

### R1. Neon that is a fitting

The sourced recipe has four ingredients and the room has one:

- a **tube**, not a plane - a thin cylinder, so it has a lit side and a shaded side
- an **emissive material** on that tube
- a **housing** it sits in: a shallow channel of ordinary metal, lit by the room's own lights.
  This is the missing ingredient and it is the whole reason the current version reads as a
  sticker - the eye needs "normally lit" beside "self-lit" in one glance to believe the second
- a **real light** at the tube, short range and colour-matched, which is what actually puts
  colour on the wall behind it

For the softness a bloom pass would give: a **radial-gradient canvas texture** flush against
the wall behind the tube, additive and depth-write-free - not a hard-edged colour plane, and on
the wall rather than in front of the sign. That is the difference between a halo and a light
pool.

**Light budget.** The three.js forum's practical figure is about ten fixed point lights against
a typical uniform ceiling near fifteen, and a forward renderer pays for every light on every
shaded fragment. So six to eight short-range lights, **no shadows** - a point-light shadow is
six cube faces - with `visible` and `intensity` toggled rather than lights added and removed,
which avoids shader recompiles, and `layers` keeping each fitting's light off geometry it has
no business touching. This game already uses `SHIP_LAYER` for exactly that. **Measured on the
phone before it is called done**: none of those are mobile numbers.

### R2. The forecourt

Portrait decides the composition. The sourced vocabulary is canopy, illuminated fascia band,
totem sign, pump island, bollards, wet forecourt - and in a tall narrow frame **the canopy is
the one element that reads badly**, so it is implied by the fascia band rather than modelled.

- an **illuminated fascia band** across the top of frame, the element canopy makers call the
  most visible part of the whole structure
- a **totem sign** standing tall at one side with the dock name and the world on it
- a **pump island** the ship is parked at, at eye level
- **bollards** and a nozzle at the near edge
- the **wet forecourt** filling the bottom third

### R3. The counter and the wall

His split, and it is better than the one it replaces because it is how a real shop works:

- **A display case that is also a counter** in the foreground, holding the **expensive**
  upgrades, each individually spot-lit under glass with the down-light cone already built.
  Individual light reads as precious.
- **The wall behind the counter** holds the **standard** upgrades: a repeating rack washed by
  one strip rather than lit per item. Repetition plus flat light reads as stock.

A split by PRICE, not by category - which retires the four-group filtering that has been
fighting this room since it was added. Nothing has to be tapped to reveal anything: both tiers
are on screen at once. The clutter was never the count, it was fifteen things competing for one
lighting setup.

### R4. The ship parks at the pump

The docking collar becomes a pump: a housing, a hose to the ship's existing hardpoint, a
nozzle, and a readout that ticks while the tank fills, reusing the canvas-plate code the prices
already use. A reskin of geometry that exists rather than a new system.

### R5. Wet ground without a reflection pass

The Half-Life: Blue Shift trick, still used on mobile: duplicate the geometry, flip it in Y
under the floor, darken it, blend it under a semi-transparent floor plane. **Only the neon
fittings and the ship get mirrored** - a handful of meshes, not the room - with a
normal-mapped floor at low roughness so the lights streak across it.

## Milestones

- [x] **R1 Neon as fittings** - tube, housing, one short-range light each, gradient pools on
      the wall. Replaces `neonBar` everywhere. Frame cost measured on the phone
- [x] **R2 The forecourt** - fascia band, totem, pump island, bollards, floor
- [x] **R3 The counter and the wall** - expensive under glass and spot-lit, standard on a
      repeating rack behind. Retires the plinths and the group filtering
- [x] **R4 The pump** - hose, nozzle, ticking readout
**R5 Wet ground - DROPPED 2026-09-13, on Gideon's word after the measurement
below.** It has no box because it is no longer owed work, and a `- [ ]` that
nobody intends to build is a permanent false negative in every count the studio
runs. The reasoning is kept rather than deleted, because the next session to
look at this room will have the same idea.

The ask was mirrored fittings and the ship under a translucent floor. Its own
      brief said to judge it against the room before spending a day on
      it, so on 2026-09-13 the room was screenshotted at 460x996 and measured.
      **The floor is barely in the picture.** `#shopStage`, the 3D room, runs
      from y 120 to y **782** of a 996-tall screen; everything below that is
      DOM. Unprojecting the camera onto the deck plane and then confirming it
      by tinting `deckMat` emissive magenta put the visible deck in the last
      ~20 px of the stage. A mirror in a twenty-pixel strip is not worth a day,
      and "the ship under a translucent floor" would be showing the ship
      through a letterbox.

      **What the same measurement did find** is that the big dead band at the
      bottom of that screen is not the floor at all - it is `#shopCard`, 124 px
      of DOM, blank because nothing is selected. Fixed under the completeness
      pass rather than here (v0.41.0).

      **Two small things were kept** from the attempt, because they are right
      on their own: the deck is glossy instead of matte, and a third roaming
      light walks with the aisle and washes it in that aisle's color, which
      costs one light rather than one per aisle and leaves `NEON_LIGHT_BUDGET`
      untouched. Nothing was lighting the deck at all before - the neon
      fittings' pool distance is 1.6 and they sit two and a half metres above
      it.

      **Dropped rather than deferred.** The room is a shelf-height shot: the
      camera is at y 0.48 looking a few degrees down at cases and signs, and
      that is the right framing for a portrait phone, where the product has to
      be big. A floor worth reflecting into would mean lowering or pulling back
      the camera, which trades the thing the screen is for against a surface
      nobody looks at. If the room is ever re-framed, this is the note that
      says a wet floor becomes worth building again.
- [x] **R6 The phone pass** - all of it judged at 1080x2340 rather than on a contact sheet,
      which is where the last three rounds of this room went wrong.
      *Done as part of round eight's W10*, which shot every screen in the game
      at 1080x2340 including the Outfitter.

# Round six: you find the gear, then the shop fits it

Written 2026-09-10 against v0.27.0, from his own brief on the 0.27.0 build:

> *"the neon lights look more like lights now which I like. it looks like the
> description of the upgrade is cutting into the bottom upgrades in the cases.
> also the ship is in front of the hull upgrade. For the neon, I was hoping for
> more of a mix of cyberpunk, matrix, and steam punk. also for the 3 different
> neon lights at the bottom, this normally signifies different categories of
> gear. can you expand on my design ideas and feel, research how to give this
> whole 3d space that feel, and find a way to split the upgrades into
> categories, that aren't all shown at once. I want most of the upgrades to be

> them to be explained in game. so you only unlock certain upgrades by finding
> them initially, the game hints at what it does and you now own it, then you
> can upgrade it at the shop."*

Standing rule 9: **when he names a mechanism, build that mechanism.** He named
one, completely, in the last two sentences. Everything below is downstream of
it.

## The two faults he can see

Both are composition, not code, and both come from the same cause: the room is
framed for the whole canvas and the canvas is not what the player can see.

1. **The card cuts into the counter.** The tray is an HTML overlay held to the
   bottom of the screen; the counter row is drawn in world space with no
   knowledge that the bottom of the frame is spoken for. Measured, not guessed -
   see S1.
2. **The ship stands in front of the wall rack.** The ship is at z 0.9 and the
   rack at z -2.15, with nine cases behind a machine parked in the middle of
   the room. This is unfixable by nudging: with a 22 degree horizontal field
   there is no "beside the ship" in portrait. The ship and the shelf must stop
   sharing a shot.

## What the research changed

Four findings, and two of them overturned what I was about to build.

**The Matrix green is exclusive, and that is the whole point of it.** Phosphor
green near `#00FF41` on near-black is a MONOCHROME grade, not one neon among
several. A surface that goes Matrix goes green-and-black only; put it beside
cyan and magenta and both identities cancel into mud. So Matrix is not a
department colour, which is what I had planned. It is **one terminal**, kept
strictly monochrome, with code falling down it.

**Gesture-only navigation is missed by most people.** NN/g measured a 21% drop
in task completion for hidden navigation and roughly half the discoverability
of visible navigation. So the aisle swipe ships with a visible dot row AND
arrows from the first commit, not as a later affordance. A swipe nobody finds is
a shop with one aisle.

**Discovery does not pause the game.** Subnautica, Valheim and Hades all do this
the same way - a short non-blocking banner at the moment of pickup, play
continues, and the shop entry itself carries no further explanation because the
fiction already did it. This game's own grammar pauses for a relic and a drive
component, and those stay: a relic is the END of a search. A schematic is a
thing you are about to USE, so it must not stop the hand that is about to use
it.

**Glow without bloom has a real technique.** A fresnel-style "fake glow" shader
on a smooth proxy mesh around the neon prop, not an emissive material on the
prop itself. It needs smooth normals, so it is an added cylinder around the
tube rather than anything baked onto the low-poly edges. This is a forward-
renderer shader, not a post pass, which is the constraint it has to satisfy.

## The mechanism: seven devices are found, not bought

The fifteen upgrades split cleanly in two, and the split is **already in the
data** - it was not invented for this round, which is why it is the right one.

Seven upgrades read `Not installed` at level zero. Those are devices the ship
does not have. Eight do not, because they are ladders on gear the ship is
already wearing - a bigger tank, a thicker hull, a better drill.

So:

| | what it is | how you get it |
|---|---|---|
| **drill, cargo, thrust, tank, scan, tow, hull, cool** | ladders on gear you already have | the Outfitter sells them, depth-gated as now |
| **magnet, survey, bomb, laser, auto, drone, reactor** | devices you do not have | **found in the ground**, then the Outfitter improves them |

Nothing about the second column is buyable until it is found. That is "most of
the upgrades are hidden for now", and it is hidden for a reason the player can
state: *I have not found one yet.*

### Where they are, and when

One per device, buried like the relic and the drive component are - a hashed
cell on the world rather than a roll against the ore stream, so a schematic
never loses a coin flip to a cave and never eats a roll another generator was
using. Its own seed offset, 257, registered with the rest.

Two gates decide what can be down there: the **leg** it first appears on and the
**depth** it is buried below, which is the `unlock` depth the row already had.

| device | from leg | below | what the first world holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salvage Magnet | 0 | 20 m | yes |
| Deep Survey | 0 | 35 m | yes |
| Seismic Charge | 0 | 40 m | yes |
| Reactor Core | 1 | 50 m | |
| Repair Drone | 1 | 60 m | |
| Autopilot | 2 | 65 m | |
| Cutting Laser | 2 | 90 m | |

Leg 0's core is at 58 m, so the first planet holds exactly three of them, at 20,
35 and 40 metres - which is his *"introduce some of the other power ups later as
you make it further into the first planet"*, arriving at three separate moments
of one descent rather than all at the surface. Everything past that arrives with
a new world, which is his *"possibly after unlocking new planets."*

**Missable, but never lost.** Leave one in the ground, break the core, and it
comes back on the next world at a new position, because the candidate list is
"everything not yet found whose leg has come". That is deliberately kinder than
the relic. A relic is a trophy and losing one is a story; a device is a verb,
and a save that can permanently lack a verb is a save that got worse by
accident.

### The moment itself

A crate in the rock, lit, obviously not ore. Break it and a banner slides in for
four seconds carrying three things and nothing else: what it is, one line of
what it does, and that it is fitted. No tap, no pause, no modal - the drill keeps
turning. Then it is on the ship, at level one, for free, and the Outfitter has a
new row.

The free first rung is the reward for the dig. It is worth 33,300 credits across
all seven, spread over hours, and it is paid for by the fact that none of those
seven can be bought at all until the rock gives them up.

## The room: four aisles, one at a time

Four departments, each with its own bay in the room, its own sign, and its own
camera station. Swipe or tap an arrow to move along the forecourt; the camera
glides. Never more than five cases in a shot.

| aisle | holds | lit in |
|---|---|---|
| **RIG** | drill, cargo, thrust, magnet | brass amber |
| **LIFE** | tank, hull, tow, cool, drone | hot magenta |
| **SURVEY** | scan, survey, auto | cyan |
| **ORDNANCE** | bomb, laser, reactor | violet |

Ordnance is **entirely** found. Until you dig up your first charge, that aisle
is dark and unlit and the swipe passes it by - and the first time you dock after
finding one, the shop opens on that aisle with its sign coming up. A whole
department lighting for the first time is a better reward than a row appearing
in a list.

This is also the honest answer to his read of the three console bars: *"this
normally signifies different categories of gear."* He is right that coloured
lights in a row mean categories, and the room was using them for claim strain,
depth and stock. The bars become the aisle indicator - one per department, in
the department's colour, the current one burning and the rest idle - which is
both the dot row the research demands and a fitting rather than an overlay.

**The ship stops sharing a shot with the shelf.** It is parked at the pump, and
the pump is the forecourt station at one end of the sweep. Buying something cuts
the camera to it for a beat so you see the part go on, then returns. That is a
better feedback moment than a static ship behind the stock, and it is what
finally kills the occlusion instead of nudging it.

## The look: one identity per role

The blend rule, and it is the finding that makes the three styles survive being
in one room: **do not mix them on a surface, give each a job.**

- **Steampunk is the room.** Brass, copper and riveted iron are what the
  building is made of - the counter, the pump, the pipe runs, the gauges with
  real needles, the valve wheels. It reads through silhouette and albedo and
  costs no lights at all, which is why it can be everywhere.
- **Cyberpunk is the light.** Magenta and cyan, the sourced pair, rationed
  against a warm brass base - accents that cut through, never a wash. Two or
  three of the seven lights are warm filament practicals, two or three are the
  cool signage accents.
- **Matrix is the information, on exactly one surface.** The terminal behind the
  counter: phosphor green on black, monochrome, code falling down it, drawn to a
  canvas at twelve frames a second with scanlines in the texture. Nothing else
  in the room is allowed that green.

And the tubes get the fresnel proxy, because an emissive material with no bloom
behind it is a bright line and this renderer will never have bloom.

## Milestones

- [x] **S1 The two faults** - the tray's height measured on the phone and the
      room framed above it; ship and shelf separated by composition
- [x] **S2 `sim/finds.ts`** - seven devices, hashed positions on offset 257, the
      block, the break, the banner, the save field, the tests
- [x] **S3 The shop sells what you own** - `shelfStock` gains the found gate,
      departments become the layout, ordnance starts dark
- [x] **S4 The aisles** - camera stations, swipe, dot row AND arrows, the dark
      aisle. The cut-to-the-ship on a purchase was CUT: the ship is a station of
      its own at the end of the run, and moving the camera under the player
      every time they buy a rung is a thing that is charming once and irritating
      the fourth time
- [x] **S5 The look** - brass and rivets, rationed magenta and cyan, one Matrix
      terminal, fresnel proxies on the tubes. Six measured corrections, every
      one of them found by a screenshot rather than by the numbers - see the
      note below
- [x] **S6 The phone pass** - judged at 1080x2340, with the light count measured.
      *Done as part of round eight's W10.* Draw calls in the worst window are
      86 of 150; every screen has been looked at as a picture at the phone's
      aspect, which is what found the manifest crash.

## S7: the kit becomes a discovery too

From his read of 0.28.0:

> *"The 6 upgrades at the bottom feel out of place and are too big of an
> advantage to just purchase. Can you remove all 6 of the upgrades from the
> bottom of the page. Make it so you have to find them as you dig, then after
> you find them, you can upgrade them. They will only show up in the shop after
> they are found. A secret display case at the bottom of the screen pops open
> and shows all of the upgrades you have collected and lets you purchase the
> upgrades there."*

Both halves right, and the second is the sharper one. A Bulwark Field absorbs
three impacts outright and was on sale to a first-hour player for money they
would have in ten minutes.

**The mechanism was already in the ground.** Supply caches have been buried on
every world since the game had caches, and opening one already handed over a
consumable. The only thing missing was the consequence: the first one of a kind
you are given is the one that teaches the Outfitter it exists. So a cache now
prefers something you have never held, and the kit fills in as a by-product of
playing rather than as a second hunt - deliberately softer than the devices'
gate, because two gates of the same hardness would make the first hour a
scavenger list.

**The drawer.** A brass front in the counter with a handle, which drops on a
hinge while a lit shelf slides out. Three things make it read as a drawer
rather than a panel that appears: the front hinges rather than fading, the
shelf slides while it does, and the inside is dark until it opens. One drawer,
moved to whichever counter is in frame, for the same reason there are two
roaming lights rather than eight.

- [x] **S7** - the kit is found, not bought, and lives in a drawer

### What the measurements missed again, and what caught it

Three faults, three different detectors, and the pattern is the same as S1-S5.

**Two rows of three does not fit.** Measured: the drawer has 117 px of band
between the counter cases and the tray, and two rows of crates with plates want
about 160. They overlapped each other and ran under the tray. One row of six,
read by coloured lid and four-letter code, with the card expanding whichever
one you tap.

**The counter's light and the drawer wanted the same sixty pixels.** The strip
was on the counter's front lip, which is where a drawer is; the brass front
came out with a bright coloured bar through the middle of its label. It moved
under the counter TOP, which is where the light is on a real display counter
anyway - lit glass above, dark drawers below.

**A fitting's brightness is a function of its distance from the lens.** The
same tube and the same settings read as a neat lit line on a wall four metres
back and as a full-width glare at the counter: 3.2 units at that distance is
about 880 screen pixels, wider than the phone. Fittings take a `glow` scale
now.

And three bugs that only a running browser could show: a circular import
between `ui.ts` and `input.ts` that presented as "Cannot access 'k' before
initialization" with the shop simply never opening; a projection 97 px out
because the station camera is not a child of the station scene, so updating the
scene leaves the camera's matrix stale; and a test helper calling `advance()`,
which stops the clock and never gives it back - the game froze with the mode
still 'play' and the key still held, which is about as misleading as a symptom
gets, and is the trap already written down beside `startClock`.

## What the numbers missed, and the screenshots caught

Worth writing down, because it is the same lesson twice and it is about the
harness rather than about the room.

A measurement harness was built for S1 that projects every case into screen
pixels and compares it against the tray. It found the real fault immediately -
the room was composed for the whole canvas while the tray covered 40% of it -
and it was right about that. Then it passed a layout in which two of the five
plates were half off the edges of the screen.

**A case is not a point.** The harness measured projected CENTRES against a
24-pixel margin. The plates are 136 pixels wide and the outer centres were 133
pixels from the middle, so both hung over the edge while every centre was
comfortably inside. The same blind spot passed a Matrix terminal a third of
which was off the left edge.

Five more things only the screenshot could say: the light pool under the
counter was sized off the tube's LENGTH in both axes and threw a pink fog over
the whole counter; the imported wall panels are a metre tall and sit on the
deck, so the rack and the sign floated in pure black with nothing for a light
to land on; the ambient was left at a workshop's 1.15 and drowned every neon in
the room; the selection panel behind each case was a hard-edged rectangle
visible on all five at once; and the aisle name was printed by the DOM directly
on top of the 3D sign already saying it.

The rule this earns: **a harness that measures positions cannot judge a
composition.** Keep both. The numbers say what is provably wrong and the
picture says what is actually wrong, and this round needed six passes of the
second after the first had gone green.

# Round seven: fuel is the game, and a prize is rare

Written 2026-09-10 against v0.29.0, from his own brief:

> *"I dont want towing to be a thing. if you run out of gas, you should game
> over. I want digging to cost a much larger amount of fuel than just flying, so
> that when you get close to running out of fuel, you have a better chance of
> getting back safely. when you get close to running out, make it obvious that
> you are in danger and make the fuel flash red. I want there to be way less
> special resources to show up so it actually feels like a prize when you get
> one. you only start seeing new resources when you get really deep and even
> then they are rare."*

Four asks, and three of them are one system: **fuel has never actually been a
constraint, and the tow is why nobody noticed.**

## What is measured, before anything is designed

### 1. Fuel stops binding exactly when the stakes rise

A full tank, against cells of the hardest rock at that depth, at a player
plausibly kitted for the leg:

| leg | core | tank | fuel per cell of basalt | climb home | **cells a tank buys** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 58 m | 90 | 5.02 | 15 (17%) | **14** |
| 5 | 298 m | 250 | 1.05 | 41 (16%) | **199** |
| 11 | 586 m | 450 | 0.53 | 50 (11%) | **760** |

The Drill divides the cost of a cell and the Tank multiplies the supply, and
the two compound. By the end of the ladder a tank is seven hundred and sixty
cells of the hardest rock in the game, which is not a resource, it is a
formality. His *"digging should cost a much larger amount of fuel than just
flying"* is the right instinct aimed at the wrong half: **per cell, digging
already costs six times a metre of flight. What it does not do is stay
expensive.**

The fix is not a bigger number. It is to charge fuel per CELL rather than per
SECOND, so the Drill buys speed and never efficiency.

### 2. The climb home was always affordable, and never shown

The rightmost column above is the good news: getting out costs 11 to 17% of a
tank from the deepest cell in the world, at every stage of the game. His
instinct - *"you have a better chance of getting back safely"* - is already
true and has never once been communicated, because a tow meant it did not
matter.

That is what makes death fair enough to ship. The gauge can tell you exactly
what the climb costs, because the game can compute it.

### 3. The rarest thing in the game is the fourth most common

`chance` in the ore table is not a probability, it is a cumulative threshold:
`blockAt` walks ORES deepest-first and takes the first whose `chance` the roll
falls under. So each ore's real share is the gap to the next one up - and the
deepest ore, tested first, keeps its whole number.

Measured, per cell, at depth:

| depth | total ore | what is in it |
|---|---|---|
| 10 m | **10.0%** | copper 10.00 |
| 60 m | **10.0%** | amethyst 5.50, gold 0.50, silver 1.00, iron 1.50, copper 1.50 |
| 250 m | **10.0%** | **solmarrow 2.10**, umbrite 0.50, coreite 0.40, magmite 0.80, ruby 0.40, emerald 0.60, amethyst 0.70, gold 0.50, silver 1.00, iron 1.50, copper 1.50 |

Three things are wrong and all three are his complaint:

- **One cell in ten is ore, at every depth in the game.** Going deeper never
  makes a find rarer or commoner, it only changes which one. There is no
  scarcity curve at all.
- **Solmarrow is worth 132,000 and turns up at 2.10%** - four times as often as
  Umbrite at 54,000, five times as often as Coreite. The whole deep tier is
  ordered backwards.
- **Adding a deeper ore steals from the one above it** rather than adding
  density, which is why the table has quietly flattened as it grew.

### 4. Every world shows you almost everything

`coreDepth(leg) = 58 + leg * 48`, and the ore gates are at 4, 11, 22, 36, 56,
78, 105, 145, 185, 210, 245 m. So the first world, 58 m deep, already contains
copper, iron, silver, gold AND amethyst. Five of the eleven materials in the
game are on the tutorial planet. *"You only start seeing new resources when you
get really deep"* is not a change of degree; it is the opposite of what the
table does now.

## What the research settles

**Nobody wipes the save.** Not one comparable game destroys its meta-progression
on a single failed run - permadeath modes wipe a *run* or a *character*, never
the unlocks. The penalty that reads as real stakes without producing quitting
is consistently: **the run's take is lost in full, and nothing permanent is
touched.** SteamWorld Dig takes half your gold and drops your loot; Deep Rock
leaves you 25% of a failed mission; Subnautica takes only what you were
carrying.

So **"game over" here means the hold, the run and the ship - and nothing else.**
Credits already banked, every upgrade level, every relic, every drive component
and the world itself all survive. That is already harsher than any of the games
above, and it is where I am drawing the line: taking the upgrade ladder would be
the one decision no shipped game in this genre makes.

Two findings underneath it are worth more than the verdict:

**Motherload does exactly what he asked for.** Run the tank dry and the digger
explodes - game over, no rescue. And *Super Motherload* sells the rescue back as
a premium panic button: a cheap teleporter that can malfunction and kill you,
and an expensive one that always works. The Lattice has been shipping the sequel's
panic button as the default outcome.

**Which means the Fuel Cell is promoted, not replaced.** The consumable that
burns 35 fuel straight into the tank has been a minor convenience. With no tow
it becomes the thing that saves your life - and it is now something you have to
find first. No new mechanic needed; an existing one stops being decoration.

**The Point of No Return is the name for what he described.** It is the aviation
term for the moment you no longer carry the fuel to return, and the design
commentary is explicit that *it only works as tension if the player can compute
it*. That is the piece The Lattice is missing - not a bigger fuel cost, a visible
reserve.

**The warning has sourced numbers.** One continuously escalating cue per
resource rather than two discrete pops (Deep Rock keeps oxygen and health on
different sound identities so they can never be confused). Dead Space switches
colour at 75 / 50 / 25%. Subnautica's first oxygen warning is at about 40%
remaining. Haptics belong only in the last seconds - a constant buzz goes numb.
And the hard limit: **never more than three flashes a second, under 25% of the
screen, no sequence longer than five seconds** (WCAG and the Game Accessibility
Guidelines agree).

**Rarity should come from depth, not from a low roll.** The one sourced
mechanism is Motherload's: a material does not exist above its floor depth, so a
player who does not go deep never rolls for it at all. That avoids the failure
mode where a rare thing "could have dropped an hour ago" and the hunt becomes
grinding. And the moment itself wants the withheld-then-revealed treatment: a
distinct sound and colour beat at the reveal, not a background particle nobody
catches.

# The build

## F1. Fuel is charged by the cell, not by the second

The measurement says the ratio is not the problem - per cell, drilling already
costs six times a metre of flight. The problem is that the ratio **decays**: the
Drill divides the cost of a cell, the Tank multiplies the supply, and by leg 11
a tank is 760 cells of basalt.

So fuel is charged against PROGRESS THROUGH THE CELL rather than against time
spent drilling:

```
FUEL_PER_CELL(hard) = FUEL_CELL_BASE + hard * FUEL_CELL_PER_HARD
```

billed pro-rata as the cell is chewed, so a half-dug block costs half. **The
Drill now buys speed and never efficiency**, which is what keeps the constraint
alive at every level. A partial dig is charged fairly, which the per-second
model also did and which a charge-on-break model would not.

Flying is untouched: 0.8 a second, and the whole point.

## F2. The reserve is on the dial

`fuelHome()` walks the actual route back with the existing BFS - not the depth,
because a tunnel is not a straight line - and converts it to fuel at the ship's
current speed. From that, one ratio: `fuel / fuelHome`.

- **above 2.2** clear
- **2.2 to 1.5** amber, and the readout names it
- **1.5 to 1.0** red, pulsing at 2 Hz, an escalating tone, a vignette
- **below 1.0** you can no longer get home, and everything says so

The dial gets a **red band that MOVES**: the reserve you need is drawn on the
fuel gauge and grows as you descend, so you watch the arc you cannot spend eat
into the tank. That is the Point of No Return made visible, which the research
says is the only way it works at all.

Flash rate 2 Hz, the vignette under a quarter of the screen, no sequence past
five seconds - the accessibility limits are hard numbers and they are cheap to
respect.

## F3. Running dry kills you

Both zeroes kill now, fuel and hull. The ship is lost with everything in the
hold. A proper death - the ship breaks up, the screen goes, and a card says what
happened and how deep.

**Tow Insurance is deleted.** It is an upgrade whose entire subject no longer
exists. Anyone who bought a level gets **every credit they spent on it back**,
once, on load - which is the honest thing to do about deleting something
somebody paid for.

In its place, on the same axis the round is about: **the Scrubber**, which cuts
the fuel a cell costs. The survival group gets a real ladder on the game's new
central resource, and the shelf keeps fifteen rows.

## F4. Ore, re-tabled

Rarity comes from depth first, as the research says, and from the roll second.

The ladder spans **eight worlds instead of five**, so a new material arrives
roughly every planet: copper and iron on the tutorial world, and Solmarrow not
until 372 m, which is planet 7. And the deep tier's shares are inverted back the
right way round, so the most valuable thing in the game stops being the fourth
most common.

Total ore density drops from a flat 10% to about 5%, and the top four materials
go from 0.4-2.1% to 0.10-0.25%.

That halves mining income, so **the values and the ladder are re-tuned against
the econ probe rather than guessed** - which is what it is for.

## F5. A first find is an event

The first time you ever cut a given material, the game stops for a beat and
tells you what it is and what it is worth, with the banner the devices and
supplies already use. Withheld, then revealed, then a sting that is not the
ordinary collect sound.

After that it is just ore. The prize is the discovery, not the pickup.

## Milestones

- [x] **F1** fuel per cell, drill buys speed not efficiency, measured at every leg
- [x] **F2** `fuelHome`, the moving reserve band, the escalating warning, the red dial
- [x] **F3** death replaces the tow; Tow Insurance deleted and refunded; the Scrubber
- [x] **F4** the ore table: eight worlds, rarity ordering fixed, density halved
- [x] **F5** the first-find reveal
- [x] **F6** the economy re-tuned against the probe, goldens re-recorded with the diffs read

## What the probe says afterwards

| style | first upgrade | minutes to all ladders | payout spread |
|---|---|---|---|
| cautious | 1.4 min | 13.7 | 183 - 894 |
| greedy | 2.3 min | **21.4** | **0 - 563** |
| optimal | 1.0 min | 8.1 | 381 - 6841 |

Greedy loses the ship twice in twenty-four runs and takes half as long again to
get every ladder started. That is the whole round in one row: digging past your
reserve is now the thing that costs you, and the cautious player is no longer
the one being punished for it by a tow fee.

## What had to move with it, and why

The ore rebalance was not a table edit. Halving the ore doubled every mineral
gate without anybody choosing to - maxing the tree wanted 72 iron, about sixteen
hundred-cell runs of nothing but looking - so the requirement now grows by one a
rung and stops at four. Five upgrades changed which mineral they are built from,
because gold and amethyst went below the first world's core and an opening row
cannot ask for something that is not there yet. Prices were re-ordered so a row
that unseals deeper still costs more.

And the frozen world reference was re-recorded for the first time since it was
made - the one thing its own note always said would require it. The diff was
read first: of 15,639 cells, 11,053 changed rock band (already licensed), 841
changed ore, 574 stopped being ore and 368 started, against a deliberate density
cut from 10% to 7.5%.

# Round eight: one world, and a reason to be in it

Written 2026-09-10 against v0.30.0, from his own brief:

> *"I like how a lot of it is feeling but it still feels like there is a main
> component missing. can you redesign how the main overall objective works? I
> want to stay on one plannet for much longer. find more secrets, random caves,
> and other things to make the planet feel mysterious and intriguing. I want the
> entire game to be based around one planet ... I dont want to just try to dig to
> the bottom. can you fully redesign the main objective into something closer to
> dome keeper but unique. I want to remove the buildings or redesign them
> visually and their purpose. redesign the ship to look more steam punk and
> unique. redesign the blocks for a more interesting stylized feel."*

## What is actually there today, before anything is designed

An honest inventory, because most of this round is deciding what to keep.

| system | what it is | fate |
|---|---|---|
| fly and dig | 13 columns, a fixed side camera, one block at a time | **keep** |
| fuel as life | run dry and the ship is lost; the climb home is drawn on the dial | **keep** - this is round seven and it works |
| heat / gas / tremors | a heat line at 66% of the core, gas pockets, quakes that collapse tunnels | **keep**, re-tuned to a bigger world |
| ore ladder | 11 materials gated over eight planets' worth of depth | **becomes strata** |
| 15 upgrades, 6 consumables, 7 devices | the shop, the drawer, the crates in the ground | **keep** |
| **the star chart** | pick a destination, fly between planets | **cut** |
| **planet traits** | 5 traits that bend hazard rates and rules | **becomes regions** |
| **12 palettes** | a colour identity per planet: rock, fog, haze, growth | **becomes strata** |
| **coreDepth(leg)** | 58 + 48 per leg; the world gets deeper each hop | **cut** - one fixed, much larger world |
| **the Jump Drive** | 5 components, one per trait, across many worlds | **cut, and replaced** |
| **relics** | one buried artefact per planet, a permanent perk | **becomes one per region** |
| **the Heart** | the final world; breaking its core wins | **becomes the thing under this world** |
| **the claim** | 3 surface buildings that accrue strain; damage is a discount | **cut, and replaced** |
| caves | 2x2 blobs, 3-9% below 26 m | **kept and massively expanded** |
| geodes, gas pockets, caches | one-cell events on their own seeds | **keep** |

## Two facts about the code that shape what is cheap and what is not

**The multi-planet structure can fold inward.** Twelve palettes, five traits and a
per-leg core depth are already a description of twelve different places with
different rules and different rock. They were spent on twelve worlds you visit
one at a time. Spent instead on twelve REGIONS of one world, they are most of a
large, varied planet for almost no new code - the palette applies to a depth
band rather than a save slot, and a trait bends the rules of a region rather
than of a visit.

That is the single biggest lever in this round and it is nearly free.

**There is no map. Of anything.** Not of the tunnels you have dug, not of where
you have been, not of what you have found. That is survivable in a game whose
world is 58 metres of straight-down and fatal in one that is meant to be wide
and mysterious. Whatever else this round does, it has to answer that.

**The world is 13 columns wide, and widening it is NOT just a constant.** The
generator is fine - `rnd(x, d, planet)` is seeded per cell, so columns 0-12
generate exactly as they do now and anything added is new ground, which the code
already says in a comment. The RENDERER is the problem: `syncBlocks` streams a
window of rows around the ship (`row - 13` to `row + 15`) and then walks
`for (let x = 0; x < W; x++)` - the full width, every rebuild - and every
instanced pool is allocated at `WINDOW_ROWS * W`.

So at 60 columns each of about eighteen pools allocates 1,740 instances instead
of 377, and every rebuild touches five times the cells. The streaming window has
to gain a horizontal axis: a column range around `g.px`, a rebuild triggered by
crossing a column as well as a row, and `MAX_CELLS` sized off the window rather
than off `W`. That is contained, it is real work, and it is much cheaper to find
now than halfway through the build.

**The ship is coded primitives.** A box hull, a cone cowl, four struts, two
fins, a cylinder auger, a cone cab. Nothing is imported and nothing is fixed in
place by geometry, so a redesign is a rewrite of one file rather than an asset
hunt.


# What the research settled

**Dome Keeper's own developer made this exact pivot, and said why.** The
original win condition was "reach the bottom of the map." René Habermann called
it *"seriously flawed"* and wrote, in February 2022:

> *"I'm mostly thinking about searching a special underground location and to
> recover something from it. So you'd still need to dig down, but it's not sure
> where to and it will also need some time to recover."*

That shipped as Relic Hunt mode. **"I dont want to just try to dig to the
bottom" is the same conclusion the designer of the game he is pointing at
reached about his own game.** This round is not a guess.

**And the criticism to design against is specific.** Dome Keeper's content
ceiling is about ten hours - "at the ten-hour mark many players will have seen
the breadth of its unlocks" - and Eurogamer's read is that its two phases feel
*divided*, competing for attention rather than fusing. So: do not alternate
mining and something-else. **Fuse them.** The Lattice already has the material for
that, and it is not combat.

Five devices make one map last, and four of them survive procedural generation:

- **Ability gating.** Hollow Knight's rule is "each key only opens a few locks" -
  new tools open things you have already SEEN and could not pass. Backtracking
  with a new tool is itself content, and it costs no new world.
- **World-state flags.** A region marked sealed, collapsed or active changes
  meaning without changing its geometry.
- **A world-changing event that recolours the map you already have.** Terraria's
  Hardmode retroactively edits the existing world rather than generating new
  space. The research calls this the strongest procgen-friendly longevity device
  there is, and it is nearly free.
- **Authored set-pieces dropped into procgen.** Spelunky stitches hand-made room
  templates; Noita drops hand-placed structures into a generated world. This is
  the one way to get authored mystery into a seeded world.
- **Knowledge as the unlock** (Outer Wilds) - needs a journal to work at all.

The one that does **not** translate is Animal Well's layered secrecy: it is
seven years of hand placement. It needs procedural *slots* for authored content
instead, which is the Noita answer above.

**And the failure modes are named.** Mystery becomes emptiness when templates
repeat often enough to be recognised, when there is no map to track partial
progress against, or when too many unexplained hooks are open at once. Animal
Well's author: *"it can be overwhelming to walk into a room and see six doors."*

**A base earns stakes two ways.** Dome Keeper's dome can be damaged and lost.
Subnautica's base has an *internal* failure mode - it consumes power and most
bases are lost to their own hull integrity, not to attack. Deep Rock's rig is
the anti-pattern: organisationally rich, in no jeopardy at all, which is what
the current three buildings are. SteamWorld Dig adds the third thing worth
stealing: the town visibly grows at underground milestones, so progress reads
from the surface without opening a menu.

# The design

## The planet is not a resource. It is a ruin, and it is waking up.

One world. You are not the first here, and the thing you are standing on is not
inert.

### The objective: the Lattice

Buried across the whole planet - spread **wide** as much as deep - are
**Anchors**: parts of a structure that predates you and is still, barely,
running. There are nine.

Lighting an Anchor does three things, and the third is the point:

1. it pushes the **Unrest** back in its region
2. it reveals that region on your map
3. **it wakes the planet a little more**

The ninth opens the Vault at the centre, which is the end of the game.

This is the recovery pivot, and it is not a race down a line: an Anchor's
location is not known in advance, several are behind things you cannot open
yet, and the map is how you hunt.

### The pressure: Unrest, and it is the planet

Dome Keeper alternates digging with fighting, and its own reviews call that
division its weakness. The Lattice already has the material for a version that
**fuses**: cutting the world raises strain and the ground answers with tremors.

So strain grows up into **Unrest**, and it belongs to the planet rather than to
a building. Everything you cut raises it. It drives the tremors that already
exist, and past thresholds it does worse. **There is no second phase** - the
pressure is applied to the thing you are already doing, which is the fusion the
research says Dome Keeper never got.

And it is the mystery, not a meter with a monster behind it. The rules are
withheld: you learn what Unrest does by watching it, the way Rain World teaches
its hazards.

### The surface: one thing, with a stake

The refinery, the derrick and the store shed are cut. Three buildings whose
damage was three discounts is exactly Deep Rock's rig - rich-looking, no
jeopardy - and he is right that it is not a system.

In their place, **the Ballast**: a steampunk pressure-station standing over the
pad, and the only thing holding the planet quiet.

- **It decays on its own**, faster as Unrest rises. That is Subnautica's
  internal failure mode, which is the one that actually kills bases.
- **You feed it ore.** Not spend - feed. The hold is now two decisions: what is
  worth money and what is worth keeping the ground still.
- **If it empties, a region collapses.** Not a discount: you lose access to
  somewhere until you re-stabilise. That is Dome Keeper's stake.
- **It visibly grows a tier with every Anchor lit.** That is SteamWorld Dig's
  legible progress - the surface tells you how far through the game you are
  without a menu.

### The world: regions, not planets

Twelve palettes and five traits already describe twelve places with different
rock and different rules. They were spent one at a time on twelve worlds. Spent
instead on **regions of one world** - laid out across width as well as depth -
they are most of a large, varied planet for almost no new code.

Volatile ground riddled with gas. Hollow ground that is more cave than rock.
Crystalline seams. The Searing deep. Each with its own palette, its own rules,
its own Anchor.

### The mystery: authored rooms in a seeded world

The Noita and Spelunky answer, which is the only one that works in procgen: a
small library of **hand-authored vault templates** dropped at seeded, rare,
region-appropriate slots. Worked stone rather than generated rock, so you know
one when you see one.

- **sealed vaults** you can see through and cannot open until you have the tool -
  the locked door with no visible key
- **the previous expedition**, told without text: their equipment, their
  tunnels, where they stopped
- **the deep quiet**: rooms that contain nothing at all, which is what makes the
  ones that do matter

Against the named failure mode - templates you start to recognise - the library
is small but the *contents* are seeded, and most of them are rare enough that a
first playthrough sees a fraction.

### The map, which is not optional

There is no map in this game of anything. That is survivable in 58 metres of
straight-down and fatal in a world meant to be wide and mysterious - and every
mystery device the research names needs one to work.

So: a map that fills in as you dig, marks what you have found, marks what you
have found *and not understood*, and shows Unrest by region. It is the journal
too, because "not yet understood" has to read as a tracked goal rather than as
confusion.

### The event that recolours everything

The single strongest longevity device the research found, and it costs almost
no content: at a threshold - the fifth Anchor - **the planet answers.** Unrest
steps permanently, a hazard appears in ground you thought you knew, and
something new grows in old rock.

The map you have filled in becomes unfamiliar. Terraria does this with
Hardmode, and it is the cheapest possible way to make a known world strange
again.

## What this does to the session

Sessions stay what they are: dive, dig, return, spend - self-contained, no
penalty for leaving, which the mobile-pacing research is firm about. The
campaign - map coverage, Anchors, Ballast tier, Unrest - persists quietly
between them and is re-stated in one line when you come back, because the
research is equally firm that a phone game must never ask you to remember where
you were.


# The look

## The ship, designed at thirty pixels

The research is blunt about this and it overturns how I would have gone at it.
**At 30 px only things that break the OUTLINE survive.** Rivets, gauges, valve
dials, portholes, individual pipes and brass-versus-iron all vanish - a 2-3 px
brass trim band is not a colour, it is noise. Brass only reads at play scale if
it covers a whole hull panel.

What survives the squint test, in order of efficiency:

- **a chimney or stack** - a vertical cylinder breaking the roofline is the
  single most efficient steampunk signal there is, because it changes the
  outline rather than the surface
- **a boiler bulge** - a barrel-shaped body segment distinct from a flat hull
- **asymmetry** - steampunk craft are almost never symmetric front-to-back the
  way sci-fi ships are, and a symmetric hull reads as "generic vehicle"
- **one big spoked wheel**, if it is 15-20% of ship height or more
- **negative space** - an open under-frame, a gap between hull and a jutting
  pipe. Gaps read as strongly as filled shape at distance and cost nothing

And the rule that decides the rest: **one dominant feature, not several.** The
TF2 principle - one unmistakable shape cue, everything else deliberately plain
so the eye lands on the one thing.

So the ship is designed twice, on purpose, which is what the two scales
deserve:

- **the silhouette**, authored at 30 px against the tunnel and judged blurred:
  an off-centre stack, a boiler bulge under the cab, an open under-frame, the
  auger still leading. Asymmetric front-to-back.
- **the greeble**, which only exists because the Outfitter shows the ship at
  full screen: rivet rows, a brass boiler band, a pressure gauge on the flank,
  a valve wheel, a porthole cab.

And it is TESTED at 30 px rather than judged in the shop, which is where every
previous ship pass in this repo went wrong - the drill tier that "did not read"
and had to become spark count was this same mistake.

## The blocks: break the grid, not the texture

The complaint is that blocks feel plain, and the instinct is to add texture.
The sourced answer is the opposite: **vary the geometry and the phase, not the
surface.** Four changes, and three of them are free at runtime.

**Per-instance rotation and scale jitter.** A quarter-turn snap (90, 180, 270 -
which keeps normals and UVs sane on a cube) and a 10-20% scale wobble, written
into the instance matrix once at generation. Zero draw calls, zero per-frame
cost, and it is the standard fix for "obviously a grid".

**Two or three chamfered block meshes per material, swapped by index.** A
bevelled cube stops reading as a cube, and the cost is in the source mesh
rather than in the shader. There is no CC0 kit for this - a bevelled cube is
cheaper to model than a licence is to vet - so it is a handful of lines of
geometry.

**Irregular band boundaries.** Right now a rock band changes at an exact
horizontal metre, which is the most artificial line in the game. A seeded
offset per column turns every stratum boundary into a ragged seam, and Deep
Rock's own technique is exactly this shape: define the large forms irregularly,
then let surface variation fill in. Large-scale irregularity does more than any
amount of per-block noise.

**Sparse decals for cracks, veins and moss**, in one instanced batch rather
than in the shader - placed irregularly and rarely, because uniform decoration
reads as texture and rare decoration reads as detail.

Skipped, deliberately: vertex displacement and true face-blending between
neighbours. They want either a compute step or per-vertex neighbour lookups,
and they buy the least per unit of cost of anything on the list.

## Reading a dark tunnel with no post-processing

Ranked by what they buy per unit of cost, which is the only ranking that
matters with no bloom, no SSAO and no colour grading:

1. **Baked ambient occlusion at the seams**, darkened into the per-instance
   colour the bands already use. One bake, no runtime cost, and it is the
   single cheapest thing that makes a wall look solid rather than printed.
2. **Rim light as a shader term**, not a pass - one dot product of view against
   normal in the forward shader. It puts a lit contour on the edge of every
   block and on the ship, which is the half of bloom that actually matters
   here.
3. **Fog**, which the game already has, tuned per stratum.
4. **Value separation**: the tunnel dark, the rock mid, the ore and the ship
   bright. Value carries the read; hue count does not.

## The one number to respect

Mobile GPUs are commonly cited as struggling past about **100 draw calls**, and
this game's budget is already 150. That is a ceiling to stay under, not a
target to grow into - so the decals ride one instanced batch, the block
variants ride the pools that already exist, and nothing in this section adds a
draw call.


## Milestones

Ordered so each one ships and is playable, and so the two that are pure
presentation come early - they are the ones you can judge fastest, and they are
independent of the objective work.

- [x] **W1 The ship, designed at thirty pixels.** Silhouette first: an
      off-centre stack, a boiler bulge, an open under-frame, asymmetric
      front-to-back, the auger still leading. Judged blurred at 30 px against
      the tunnel, not in the shop. Then the greeble - rivets, a brass band, a
      pressure gauge, a valve wheel - which exists only for the Outfitter.
      *Cost: one file rewritten. No new systems.*

- [x] **W2 The blocks.** Per-instance quarter-turn and scale jitter; two or
      three chamfered mesh variants per material; ragged stratum boundaries
      instead of straight horizontal lines; sparse crack and vein decals in one
      instanced batch; baked seam AO folded into the per-instance colour; a rim
      term in the forward shader. *Cost: no new draw calls, and the ragged
      boundaries are rock-for-rock, which the frozen baseline already permits.*

- [x] **W3 The world gets wide.** `W` from 13 to about 61, and the streaming
      window gains a horizontal axis - a column range around the ship, a rebuild
      on crossing a column, and `MAX_CELLS` sized off the window rather than off
      `W`. **This is the one piece of work that is invisible from the outside
      and is not optional**: at 61 columns the instance buffers go from 2.3 MB
      to 10.6 MB and every rebuild touches five times the cells. Measured, not
      estimated.

- [x] **W4 Regions.** The twelve palettes and five traits stop being planets and
      become regions of one world, in width and depth. `coreDepth(leg)` and the
      chart go. One fixed world about 450 m deep.

- [x] **W5 The map.** Fills in as you dig, marks finds, marks the
      not-yet-understood, shows Unrest per region. Nothing else in this round
      works without it.

      *Done.* A Survey screen on a canvas: the ground you have had a lamp on,
      washed in each region's own rock colour four cells to a tile; your own
      tunnels exact over the top of it; the pad, the ship and every device and
      cache you have pulled out of the rock; region names over their own ground,
      and three question marks over ground you have never entered. A survey
      grid and a 50 m ruler are drawn across the WHOLE world and not only the
      explored part, so unsurveyed ground reads as empty squares on a chart
      rather than as a hole in the screen. Vertical drag to scroll, CENTRE ON
      SHIP to get back, and a surveyed percentage, which is the partial-progress
      readout the research says procedural mystery needs to avoid reading as
      emptiness. Unrest per region is the one piece deferred: it lands with
      Unrest itself in W6.

- [x] **W6 Unrest and the Ballast.** Strain grows into a planet-wide meter that
      everything you cut raises; the Ballast decays against it, is fed with ore,
      collapses a region if it empties, and grows a tier per Anchor. The three
      old buildings are cut.

      *Done.* Unrest is PER REGION rather than planet-wide, which was the one
      real change to the plan: a single number would have been a second fuel
      gauge, and twelve of them give the map something to show and make
      abandoning worked-out ground a move. Everything you cut raises it, a cell
      at the floor costing two and a half times one at the surface. Past the
      second band tremors fire above the depth line and up to three times as
      often; past the third the rock closes up about a third. None of it is
      stated anywhere - the map shows a bar under a place's name and nothing
      says what the colours mean.

      The refinery, derrick and shed are gone, and so are `claim.ts`,
      `claimyard.ts` and `claimsigns.ts`. In their place one machine: a riveted
      pressure vessel with a sight glass for the level, a dial whose needle is
      the planet's Unrest, a stack that vents faster as it climbs, and nine
      collars that stack one per Anchor. It drains while you dig, you feed it
      banked ore at the pad, and when it empties a region comes down - tunnels
      filled in, ground unbreakable, and it waits at the door rather than
      landing on somebody who is still underground. Shoring one back costs 45%
      of the tank and never restores the tunnels.

- [x] **W7 Anchors, and vaults.** Nine Anchors across the regions. A small
      library of authored vault templates dropped at seeded rare slots -
      sealed ones you can see and not open, the previous expedition, and empty
      ones so the full ones mean something.

      *Done.* Nine Anchors, one in each region of the top three rows - the
      deepest row holds none, because that row is the Vault's. Each stands in
      a hand-authored hall of worked stone: a chamber you have to cut into, and
      a niche in the middle of it. The Anchor cannot be mined at all; you fly
      down to it and it lights. Lighting one pushes its region's Unrest back,
      draws the whole region onto your map, and gives the Ballast a permanent
      tier - a collar on the machine at the pad.

      Three of the nine are behind SEALED stone, which nothing cuts until you
      have found the Cutting Laser somewhere else. That is Hollow Knight's rule
      applied for free: a tool that opens something you have already seen.

      Sixteen more rooms at seeded slots, drawn from a pool that is mostly
      EMPTY on purpose - if every worked room held something, worked stone
      would be a reward rather than a question. The rest are the previous
      expedition (their shaft, their spoil, the crate they left) and a worked
      chamber round a pocket.

      Five characters of authored world, 1,602 cells of it, 5.8% of the planet.
      The whole library is legible as drawings in `src/sim/vaults.ts`.

- [x] **W8 The planet answers.** At the fifth Anchor, Unrest steps permanently,
      a hazard appears in ground you already know, and something new grows in
      old rock. The cheapest possible way to make a mapped world strange again.

      *Done.* Five of nine, and three things fire at once. Every region gains a
      permanent floor in Unrest and every cell cut from then on costs 35% more.
      Tunnels in restless ground CLOSE while you are docked - filling with
      rubble, never rock, never the pad's own shaft, and proportional to how
      angry that region is, so quiet ground stays exactly as you left it for
      ever. And Blooms start generating from 4 m down to the halfway line,
      worth more per kilo than anything in the upper half - because waking the
      planet has to be something a player chooses, not a punishment for playing
      well.

      The hazard is aimed at the one thing in this game a player actually owns:
      the shape they cut. The route home is computed from it.

- [x] **W9 The Vault.** The ninth Anchor opens the centre, and that is the end
      of the game. Other planets are what comes after, later.

      *Done.* A fifteen-by-thirteen chamber at the middle column of the deepest
      band - the one place on this world that can be described without a map.
      Two shells: ordinary worked stone, so finding it reads like finding any
      other room, and inside it a seal that NOTHING cuts until all nine Anchors
      are lit. The ninth puts the centre on your map and opens the seal; flying
      down to the core ends the game, and the game does not end the session -
      the planet is handed back with everything still in it.

      **And the old ending went with it.** The navigation chart, the jump drive
      and its five components, the crossing between worlds, the breach, the
      Core Shards and the Planet Core itself are all deleted - 1,300 lines and
      ninety call sites. Round eight made this one planet; leaving a second
      objective in it would have been worse than either.

- [x] **W10 The phone pass**, and a long play of the whole thing rather than of
      any one milestone.

      *Done, with one thing left open and named.* Every screen shot at
      1080x2340 and looked at, which found a crash: cutting into an Anchor hall
      put `worked` stone in the hold and the manifest threw on a material with
      no DEF entry. Draw calls measured in the worst window round eight can
      build - a sealed hall at 306 m on a woken planet with a region down -
      at 86 of 150. Version 0.31.0 with the round's changelog in the player's
      words. `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to describe the game this actually is.

      The long play found the two that mattered: a lit Anchor was an
      unbreakable plug in its own column, so six of the nine were unreachable
      by digging down to them; and the collapse cascade had no bottom. Both are
      fixed, and both now have tests that fail without the fix.

      **Open:** no automated run has played a campaign through to the Vault.
      Every piece is proved separately - `every Anchor lights by digging down
      its own column` covers all nine - but the probe has never lit more than
      one, and each stall has turned out to be its own policy rather than the
      game. Its limits are written into its own header. A human play is the
      next thing this needs, not another probe fix.

## What I am deliberately not doing

**Not adding combat.** Dome Keeper's own reviews say its two phases feel
divided; the fusion here is that the pressure applies to digging itself. Adding
a second verb would import the exact criticism the research warns about.

**Not hand-authoring a secret world.** Animal Well is seven years of hand
placement and does not survive procgen. Authored templates in seeded slots is
the version that does.

**Not keeping the star chart.** It is a good screen for a game about visiting
places and this is now a game about one place. It comes back if the sequel does.

## The honest risk

This is the largest change the game has had - it replaces the objective, the
world's shape, the surface, and two art passes. **W3 and W4 together break every
golden test in the repo**, because they change what the world IS. That is
expected and manageable, but it means the middle of this round will have a
stretch where the suite is red by design, and I will re-record with the diffs
read rather than fixing them one at a time.

If you would rather have it in smaller bites, the natural split is **W1-W2 first
as a look pass you can judge in a day**, then the objective work as its own
round.

# Appendix: rounds one to three, as planned and shipped

Kept because the reasoning is why the game is shaped the way it is. Everything below has
shipped; the milestone list at the top is the live one.

The ask, in his words:

> "can you write out a plan to expand the game, add additional upgrades and power ups, make
> each planet feel and look different, have an overall goal besides just digging for
> resources, have the ship actually look like it is flying between planets."

Five things, and they are not five separate features. Four of them are the same feature seen
from different sides, which is what this plan is mostly about.

---

## What the game is now, and what is actually missing

The loop works. Fly down, cut rock, fill a 60 kg hold, come back up, sell, buy a rung of a
ladder, go deeper. Heat at 70 m and tremors at 85 m give depth a price. Relics give one
permanent keepsake per planet. Breaking a core destroys the planet and moves you to the next
one, which is harder and richer.

What is missing is not content. It is that **nothing above the run has a shape**:

- **Planet N+1 is the only place you can go.** There is no choice at the top level, so the
  traits — Volatile, Hollow, Crystalline, Searing — are flavour that happens *to* you rather
  than anything you can seek out or avoid. A trait you cannot choose is a weather report.
- **The planets differ by numbers, not by looking different.** Sky colours change; the rock,
  the fog, the dust and the silhouette do not. Every world is the same cave with the tint
  moved.
- **There is no reason to stop.** Shards accumulate, credits accumulate, and the honest
  answer to "why am I doing this" is "the number goes up". `CRAFT.md`: *"Money is a rung:
  every amount you earn makes the last amount irrelevant."*
- **Leaving a planet is a modal dialog.** The single most cinematic beat in the game — you
  just destroyed a world — is a box with a button.

So the plan is one arc: **give the top level a map, a goal, and a journey**, and make the
worlds on that map worth telling apart.

---

## The spine: The Drift, the Jump Drive, and the Heart

The fiction is already there and unused. You are a contracted driller working the **Verdax
Drift**. The plan makes the Drift a place you are trying to get *out* of.

**The goal: build a Jump Drive and reach the Heart of the Drift.**

The Jump Drive takes **five components**. Each one is buried on a world of a particular
trait, and only on that trait:

| Component | Found on | Trait |
|---|---|---|
| Guidance Spine | a Stable world | `stable` |
| Plasma Injector | a Volatile world | `volatile` |
| Void Resonator | a Hollow world | `hollow` |
| Lattice Prism | a Crystalline world | `crystalline` |
| Thermal Core | a Searing world | `searing` |

With all five aboard, the chart opens a route to **The Heart** — one final world, harder than
anything before it, whose core ends the game.

Why this shape and not a longer story:

- **It makes the trait the decision.** You need a Searing world, so you go looking for one on
  the chart and accept what a Searing world costs you. That is `CRAFT.md`'s *"gate an upgrade
  behind a place, not a price"* applied to the whole game rather than to one shop row.
- **It is a collection, so its value does not decay.** Three of five is a real answer to
  "what have I got".
- **It is missable, and that is the point.** Break the core with the component still in the
  ground and it is gone with the planet. `CRAFT.md`: *"Make the best reward missable."*
  Crucially it is **recoverable but costly** — another world of that trait will come round on
  the chart — so a mistake is a detour, never a dead run. A permanently unwinnable save is
  the one outcome this must not have.
- **It ends.** And after it ends, the Drift stays open: the chart keeps generating worlds, so
  the endless game people are already playing is still there, now with a completed thing
  behind it.

The component is a **second buried object**, generated like the relic and deliberately deeper
than it, with its own finder cue. It is not a relic and does not use the relic's slot: the
relic is a perk you keep, the component is a key you spend.

---

## The chart: choosing where to go

After a core breaks, instead of a modal announcing planet N+1, you get **the chart** — two or
three candidate worlds, each showing:

- name and trait, with the trait's blurb
- depth to core
- whether it is known to hold a Jump Drive component you still need
- a **transit cost in fuel**, from how far it is

Two or three, never one, and never a good option beside a bad one. `CRAFT.md`: *"Two upside
gates beat a good gate and a bad gate."* A shallow Hollow world with nothing you need against
a deep Searing world holding the Thermal Core is a real question, and the answer changes
depending on what you have.

The chart is deterministic from a seed, so a save is reproducible and the golden tests can
assert its properties — in particular the one that matters: **every trait you still need must
keep appearing**, or the run can strand itself.

---

## The transit: actually flying there

The chart choice hands off to a real sequence, not a dialog:

1. the ship lifts off the pad and climbs out of the atmosphere
2. the planet you just broke recedes behind you, in pieces
3. a starfield with real parallax, the drive lit and running
4. the destination swells, its own colour and its own sky
5. the ship descends through cloud and settles onto the new pad

It is a scene, and it is where the goal gets restated: the Jump Drive's five slots are on
screen during the crossing, so every journey shows you how close you are. Skippable after the
first time — a cutscene you cannot skip becomes a tax on the twentieth playthrough — but
worth watching once.

No minigame in it. `CRAFT.md` is clear that a mechanic which cannot be failed or optimised is
a rhythm, not a decision, and a transit minigame would be exactly that.

---

## Making the worlds look different

Right now a planet is a pair of sky colours. It should be a **palette**, applied everywhere at
once, so a world reads as somewhere else before you have dug a metre:

- **rock**: each world gets its own band colours for the shallow, middle and deep rock
- **atmosphere**: fog colour and density, haze tint, dust colour and thickness
- **sky and backdrop**: the gradient it already has, plus the parallax silhouette behind the
  tunnels
- **signature**: one thing per trait you can see from the surface —
  - *Volatile*: gas venting from the rock face, and the air is dirty
  - *Hollow*: huge open caverns, and light carries much further in them
  - *Crystalline*: crystal formations that catch the lamp and glow through rock
  - *Searing*: veins of lit magma in the deep rock, and the air shimmers
  - *Stable*: clean, cold, quiet — the control against which the others read

`CRAFT.md`: *"A threshold the player cannot see is not a mechanic"* — the same argument
applies to a whole world. Four coordinated signals, not one tint.

---

## Upgrades and power-ups

Ten upgrades now, in four groups. The gaps are specific rather than general.

**New permanent upgrades:**

| Upgrade | Group | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Hull Plating** | survival | Hull is a flat 100 forever. The only survival stat with no ladder. |
| **Salvage Magnet** | rig | Ore left on the ground when the hold filled has to be re-approached one cell at a time. |
| **Deep Survey** | instruments | Ore through rock at a radius — distinct from Scanner, which is light and framing. Also points at the buried component. |
| **Repair Drone** | survival | Slow hull repair underground: turns a bad run into a long one instead of a tow. |
| **Reactor** | ordnance | Power cell ceiling and trickle rate. Ordnance currently has no ladder of its own. |

**New consumables**, on the other axis — one run, never a ceiling:

| Kit | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Overdrive** | 20 s of much faster drilling |
| **Bulwark** | absorbs the next two hull hits outright |
| **Pulse** | lights up every ore in a wide radius for 30 s, through rock |

And **field power-ups**: caches already exist as a discovery moment, and they should
sometimes hand you a *temporary* effect rather than goods — aimed, per `CRAFT.md`, at the
bottleneck you are actually in.

---

## Status

- **1. Planet identity** — shipped in 0.17.0. Twelve palettes, applied to rock, fog, haze,
  dust and the silhouettes at once. Ore keeps its own colour everywhere.
- **2. The chart and the transit** — shipped in 0.18.0.
- **3. The Jump Drive and the Heart** — shipped in 0.18.0. Components generate, are collected,
  are tracked in the manifest, and the Heart appears on the chart once the drive is complete.
- **4. Upgrades** — shipped in 0.19.0. Hull Plating, Salvage Magnet, Deep Survey, Repair
  Drone and Reactor Core, taking the shop from ten cases to fifteen. Three of the five had
  their material changed by a test before they landed: `hull` wanted iron from 11 m behind a
  45 m seal, which is CRAFT.md's *"two gates on one thing means one of them is decoration"*,
  and `drone` wanted emerald from inside the heat zone for something you buy before reaching
  it.
- **5. Consumables** — shipped in 0.19.0. Overdrive, Bulwark Field and Survey Pulse. The kit
  had three items and all three UNDID something (heat, damage, an empty tank); these buy a
  window in which the ship is better than it is, which is the axis that was missing. Bulwark
  counts impacts rather than seconds because heat soak is a drain and would eat a timer before
  the thing it exists to stop ever arrived.

- **6. Per-trait ambience** — shipped in 0.20.0. A palette is a still image; two worlds
  painted differently still behaved identically. Each trait now emits something of its own in
  the air — gas out of the walls, embers from below, glints, falling grit — and Stable emits
  nothing at all, which is what makes the others read. The timing is a pure reducer for the
  same reason everything else is: the preview browser stops `requestAnimationFrame` when
  hidden, so anything on a timer cannot be tested by eye there.

**Still open:** caches that sometimes hand you a temporary effect instead of goods, aimed at
whatever bottleneck the player is actually in.

**Wanting a playtest before anything else is built on them:** the chart's shallow/poor against
deep/rich balance, which is the central new decision and was tuned by one person looking at it;
the nine-second crossing, which may be four seconds too long by the twentieth planet; and
whether the per-trait ambience is dense enough to tell a Volatile world from a Stable one while
flying past.

Two things changed shape while building, both worth recording:

**The leg and the world had to be split.** `g.planet` was doing two jobs — difficulty ladder
and identity — and a chart offering three worlds at the same leg needs those to be different
numbers. `g.world`, `g.trait`, `g.coreOff` and `g.rich` are the chart's answer, and they all
default to the pre-chart behaviour so old saves load unchanged.

**The trait had to be stored rather than hashed.** `traitOf()` returns Stable only for planet
zero, so a Guidance Spine gated behind a Stable world would have been unobtainable for the
whole game. The chart is now the authority on what a world is, which is where that decision
belonged anyway.

---

## The way in: a title screen and a first-run intro

The ask:

> "can you create an intro screen? if it is the first time starting, make a little intro going
> through the story and objective. if the game has already been started by the player before,
> can you just have a start screen that has normal first screen options like, new game,
> continue, settings, notes."

The game currently boots straight into a ship on a pad, which was fine when the whole of it
was "dig down, sell, upgrade". It is not fine now: there is a Jump Drive to assemble and a
Heart to reach, and **nothing anywhere tells the player either of those things exists** until
they break their first core, which is an hour in.

### What the intro is for, and what it must not be

`CRAFT.md`: *"DO NOT INVENT A SYMBOL FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN SHOW."* The rule was written about
HUD elements and it applies exactly here — an intro that is paragraphs of fiction over a black
screen is the same mistake in a different costume. The game already owns a starfield, twelve
painted worlds, a ship, and a planet coming apart in pieces. The intro should be those things,
with one line of text over each.

Three hard requirements, all of them learned already this session:

- **Skippable, always.** A cutscene you cannot skip is a tax on every replay. The crossing
  needed this and shipped without it once.
- **It must state the OBJECTIVE, not just the mood.** "Five pieces of a jump drive, one buried
  on each kind of world" is the sentence the player needs; the rest is flavour.
- **It must not block the tests.** Every one of the 24 e2e specs boots into play and starts
  driving. A screen in front of that breaks all of them at once, and the fix is a dismissal in
  the shared `beforeEach` rather than a bypass flag — so the title is exercised on every run
  instead of being the one path nothing covers.

### The shape

**First run** (no save in `localStorage`): the intro plays immediately. Six beats over a live
3D scene, auto-advancing, tap to go faster, SKIP in the corner throughout. It ends by starting
a new game.

**Every run after** (a save exists): a title screen over the same live scene.

| | |
|---|---|
| **CONTINUE** | straight back in, and the default |
| **NEW GAME** | confirms first — it wipes credits, upgrades, shards and relics — then replays the intro |
| **SETTINGS** | the existing pause sheet: audio, restart, build stamp |
| **NOTES** | the same sheet with what's-new already open |

Settings and Notes **reuse the pause modal rather than duplicating it.** It is already the
settings screen — audio toggles, restart progress, version, run log, what's new, build stamp —
and a second copy of those controls is a second place for them to drift. It changes its
heading and its close button depending on where it was opened from, and nothing else.

### Two things it gets for free

**The AudioContext gesture.** `audioInit()` currently rides on the first `pointerdown`
anywhere, which means the first tap of the game is silent. A title screen is a tap before
anything is at stake, which is the correct place for it.

**A reason for the showcase scene to exist.** `transit.ts` already has a starfield at three
depths, palette-painted planets, the ship, and debris. The title and the intro drive the same
scene rather than a second one — so a world in the intro is drawn by exactly the code that
draws it in the crossing.

---

## Round two: the way in, the shop, and how to actually see this stuff

The ask, in his words:

> "for the intro can you make it less like a slide show and more like the ship is flying past
> planets. when the intro ends, have it fly to the planet. if you hit continue, have the ship
> take off and fly to the planet the player is currently at. If there is no saved game, make
> sure the continue button is greyed out. Also dont explain the whole story of the game. Make
> it feel more mysterious."
>
> "can you also revamp the shop? some of the words are cut off and it feels a bit cluttered. I
> want future upgrades that dont unlock until later to be hidden."
>
> "I want you to find a good way to play test and trouble shoot the game ... if there are any
> rules keeping you from doing something that could be beneficial, make sure the rule is
> actually needed ... use pre-made assets whenever you can."

---

### 0. First, a way to SEE motion - because I currently cannot

This comes first because everything else depends on it. "Less like a slide show" is a
judgement about **movement**, and every tool I have produces **stills**. I have been approving
animation by looking at single frames and reasoning about the code in between, which is
exactly the habit that cost four rounds on the lighting artefact.

**The filmstrip harness** (`scripts/filmstrip.mjs`): drive the built game under Playwright,
advance GAME time deterministically through `advance()`, screenshot at fixed intervals, and
composite the frames into **one contact-sheet PNG**. A whole sequence then becomes a single
image I can actually look at.

- Deterministic, because it runs on the tick seam - a slow machine changes nothing.
- Named scenarios (`intro`, `continue`, `crossing`, `shop`) so a repro is a command rather
  than a paragraph of set-up.
- Console errors collected and printed with the sheet. Three separate bugs this session were
  sitting in the console and were found by eye instead.

*Challenges.* Compositing without a new dependency - `sharp` is not in the repo and ASSETS.md
says to install it in a scratch directory rather than depend on it. The answer is to composite
**in the browser**: hand the screenshot buffers back into the page as data URLs, draw them into
a canvas grid, read one PNG out. No dependency, and the page is already open.

The second challenge is the one that keeps biting: under the dev server a dynamic `import()`
resolves to a **different module instance** than the one the loop is running, so the harness
drives everything through the `?debug` seam and never through an import.

---

### 1. The intro: a flight, not a slide show

It is currently six discrete *shots*, each easing its planet in from nothing. That is a slide
show with a dissolve, and it is a fair description of what is wrong with it.

**The rework:** one continuous flight. Planets sit along a line ahead of the ship, the ship
moves forward at a constant rate, and each world approaches, passes to one side and falls
behind. Captions fade over the top, **decoupled from the visuals**, so text changes without
anything cutting.

**The landing.** The intro and CONTINUE end on the same shared sequence: the destination grows
until it fills the frame, the ship pitches toward it, atmosphere washes the screen out, and the
game is there. Shared deliberately - "fly to the planet" is the same event either way, and two
copies would drift.

- **Intro** = flythrough, then land on Verdax.
- **CONTINUE** = take off, then land on the world you are actually on.
- **No save** = CONTINUE greyed and inert, not hidden. He asked for greyed and he is right: an
  absent button tells a new player nothing, a greyed one says "this is where your game will be".

**Mysterious, not explanatory.** One of the six beats explains the core loop, which the player
is about to be taught by playing it. Cutting to five, shorter, and dropping that beat. What
must survive is the *objective* - five pieces, one per kind of world - because it is the thing
the game otherwise never says. Mystery is withholding the explanation, not the goal.

*Challenges.* The existing test asserts the intro names the jump drive, five, the Heart, and
where the pieces are. A shorter script may drop a word, and the test has to be re-aimed at
*the objective survives* rather than *these four strings appear* - the literal-versus-property
mistake, which I have already made twice this session.

---

### 2. The shop: fewer things, bigger, nothing cut off

Three faults, and only one of them is layout.

**Words cut off** has an exact cause: `drawPlate()` calls `fillText` at a fixed 62 px with no
width limit on a 512 px plate, and "SALVAGE MAGNET" does not fit. Measure and shrink to fit,
rather than shortening the names.

**Cluttered** is the count. The shop went from ten cases to fifteen without the room changing,
and five of the fifteen are things you cannot buy yet.

**Hiding locked upgrades** runs straight into a rule:

> `CRAFT.md`: *"Locking shop stock behind 'deepest ever reached' is the cheapest structural
> progression available, and it should be shown, not hidden: a row that says 'Sealed until
> 90 m' is a reason to go deeper. A hidden row is nothing at all."*

**That rule is right about the next gate and wrong about all of them.** A case reading "Sealed
until 90 m" when your best is 78 m is a reason to go deeper. The same case when your best is
12 m is furniture: it cannot be planned toward, it is five rungs away, and it is one of five
crowding a phone screen. The rule was written at ten upgrades and two gates; at fifteen and six
it stopped being true and nobody noticed, because it was being applied rather than measured.

**Correction: show the NEXT sealed upgrade, hide the rest.** That keeps everything the rule was
defending and removes the clutter. `CRAFT.md` gets updated rather than worked around.

**Layout.** With the far cases gone the count is dynamic - about eight early, fifteen late - so
the room lays out from the count rather than from a fixed table: two columns while eight or
fewer fit, the back rack added above that. Fewer cases also means each can be bigger, which is
most of what makes a plate readable.

### 3. Pre-made assets, where the rule says to use them

ASSETS.md's rule is a **measurement**, not a preference: *"Import what the player reads at its
real size. Model in code anything that is thirty pixels tall and judged on silhouette"* - and,
added later, *"over about two hundred pixels and permanently on screen, import."*

Applying it rather than skipping it: **the planets in the intro and the crossing are two to six
hundred pixels tall and on screen for the whole sequence.** They are untextured spheres, which
is a large part of why the intro reads as coloured balls sliding about. That is squarely on the
import side of a rule I have been half-reading.

**One rock normal map from ambientCG**, about 45 KB, on the planet sphere - and, per the rule
that lets a photographed texture into a stylised game at all, **the normal only, never the
colour map.** Each world keeps its palette colour and gains relief and a real terminator.

*Challenges.* The download is a 9 MB zip for one 45 KB file and `sharp` is not a dependency -
both already solved in ASSETS.md, via a scratch directory and `npx`.

**Audio stays synthesised**, and not out of habit: ASSETS.md records that both CC0 audio
libraries need a browser session or an API key and are unavailable unattended, and this score
mixes by depth, danger and zone off one scheduler, which a recording cannot do.

---

### 4. Rules that were wrong, and are being corrected

- **`CRAFT.md`, sealed shop rows.** Show the next one, not all of them.
- **`CLAUDE.md`, "the only binary assets are two woff2 font files".** Stale - there are three
  WebP textures in `src/textures/`, imported through the bundler. A rule that misdescribes the
  repo teaches the next session something false about what is allowed.

## Round three: point the ship where it is going, land it, and dress the rock

The ask:

> "can you make it look like the ship is actually flying toward the planets rather than always
> facing us in the intro and flying scenes? it should point the drill end toward what it is
> flying to. when the screen cuts from the ship flying to it being on the planet, and you have
> a short landing sequence before the player can take control of the ship? I want the ship to
> be shown lowering itself onto the landing pad right before the player takes over. I also
> want the actual dirt and rocks to change color and texture with each planet. add additional
> details like moss patches, frost, plants, oil."

---

### 1. Fly nose-first, not broadside

Right now the flight sets `rig.rotation.z = PI` and leaves it there, which points the drill up
the screen. The ship is flying "up" past worlds that are receding into the distance - two
different directions at once, and the eye reads the one it can measure, so the ship looks like
it is holding station while the scenery slides by.

**The drill has to point at the thing it is going to.** In practice that is a three-quarter
rear view: the ship seen from behind and slightly above, drill into the screen, drive toward
the camera. Which is also better-looking, because the thrusters are the lit end and they end
up facing us.

The geometry: at rotation zero the drill points at the floor - local `-Y`, because
`FACE_ANGLE.down` is 0 - so pointing it into the screen means taking `-Y` to `-Z`.

*Challenges.* `rig.rotation` is an Euler in XYZ order and it is the same node the game and the
station use, so the flight has to set it and put it back rather than assume a resting value.
And "into the screen" is not one fixed angle once the ship starts turning toward a world it is
about to land on - the descent has to rotate from the cruise attitude to a nose-down one, or
the ship arrives flying sideways into a planet. Verified on a filmstrip, because an orientation
is exactly the thing a still frame can lie about.

---

### 2. Land the thing before handing it over

At the moment the descent fills the screen with the planet's surface, flashes, and the next
frame is a ship parked on a pad with the HUD up. The arrival is asserted rather than shown.

**A short settle, in the game's own scene.** The ship comes in above the pad with the drive
lit, drops the last few metres under thrust, touches down, the gear takes the weight, dust goes
up - and *then* the controls come alive.

- A mode of its own (`settle`), because during it the d-pad must do nothing. A player who can
  fly during a landing animation will, and then the animation is fighting them.
- Two seconds at most. It happens on every crossing and every CONTINUE, and the second time
  you see it, it is a wait.
- It reuses the drop the game already has: the ship eases from a few metres up to the pad on
  the same `approach()` smoothing everything else uses, so it looks like the game rather than
  like a cutscene bolted to it.

*Challenges.* Input has to be locked without freezing the frame loop - the world still has to
render. The e2e polls for mode `play` as the signal that the way in has finished, so a new mode
in front of it lands on every spec at once; that is the third time this session, and the
answer is the same as before, drive it on the tick seam rather than the wall clock. And
`goSurface()` currently teleports the ship to the pad, so the settle has to run *after* it and
own the ship's position for its duration.

---

### 3. The ground itself, per world

The palettes tint rock colour. That is one channel, and it is why every world still reads as
the same stone under a different light.

**Three more channels, all per palette:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **roughness** | ice is smooth and catches the lamp; ash is matte and eats it |
| **relief** | how hard the normal map bites - weathered against sharp |
| **growth** | what lives, settles or leaks on the rock face |

The growth is the visible one, and it is the ask: **moss patches, frost, plants, oil**, plus
ash drifts and salt crusts to fill the twelve. One signature per world, scattered on a fraction
of rock faces, so a world is recognisable from a single wall rather than from the horizon.

Placed like the seam flecks already are - small instanced quads at `z 0.5`, in front of the
rock face and behind everything else - because that geometry is already proven and already
inside the draw budget. **One instanced mesh for all of it, not one per world**, so it is a
single extra draw call; the count at 96 m is 66 of 150.

*Challenges, and the first one is the one that eats a day if it is got wrong.*

**Every roll must be on its own seed offset.** `CLAUDE.md` is explicit: consuming an existing
roll shifts every ore at every depth on every planet, and the diff looks like three lines.
Growth rolls on `(x + 91, d + 29, planet + 131)` and touches nothing else.

**It must not change a single block id.** Growth is decoration drawn on top of a cell, not a
cell type, so `test/baseline/blocks-preadditive.json` stays green - and that is the proof, not
the intention.

**Depth bands.** Moss and plants belong near the surface where the damp is; frost belongs
anywhere on a cold world; oil seeps deep. A growth that ignores depth is wallpaper.

---

## Order of work

Each slice ships on its own: typecheck, golden tests, build, size guard, e2e, CI, deploy.
Nothing sits half-finished on `main`.

1. **Planet identity.** Palettes, atmosphere, per-trait signatures. Pure data plus rendering,
   no rules change, so it is the safest large visible change and it makes everything after it
   look better.
2. **The chart and the transit.** Choosing where to go, and flying there. Replaces the modal.
3. **The Jump Drive and the Heart.** Components, progress, the final world, the ending.
4. **Upgrades and power-ups.** Independent of the other three, so it lands last and can be
   tuned against the finished shape.

The risk to watch across all four is the one `CLAUDE.md` already names: **world generation is
a pure seeded hash, and anything new that generates content must roll on its own seed
offset.** Components, signatures and caverns all generate, and all three will silently shift
every ore in the game if they consume an existing roll.

# Round nine

Round eight closed on 2026-09-12 with W1-W10 ticked. What follows is the work
it left open, in the order it should be done. **The first two are not features -
they are the things that stop round eight being nine hours of unplayed work.**

No new design asks came in during round eight. Every milestone below is either
something the round left behind or something `POLISH.md` wants before a ship;
the shape of the game is not up for revision until R9a has happened.

- [x] **R9a A human play of the whole campaign.** `/playtest`. Round eight has
      had no human minute in it, and the long-play probe cannot answer the
      questions that matter: does hunting Anchors feel like a hunt or like a
      checklist, is the Survey map worth opening, does the Ballast read as a
      stake or as a chore, and does the fifth Anchor land as an event.

      **Done 2026-09-18.** He played the live v0.48.0 build on his phone and
      liked it, and his words are in `playtests/lattice.md`. **Ticked on the
      judgement, not on a completion**: he did not say he reached the Vault, and
      three of the four questions above are still unanswered - the Survey map,
      the Ballast, and whether the fifth Anchor lands. What he did answer is the
      first one and the one that mattered most, sideways: *"I think any more
      than 7 anchors would feel like a checklist."* That is the checklist half
      of question one, and it was enough to retire the second month's
      ranked-first candidate and to set the governing rule of Round twelve.

      The three open questions are worth asking again after T2 and T3 ship,
      because both of them change what the map and the tally do, and an answer
      about the old screens would be an answer about a game that no longer runs.

      Everything after this is provisional until it is done. Whatever comes out
      of it goes to `playtests/lattice.md` verbatim, and it outranks every
      other milestone here.

- [x] **R9b The first hour introduces the game that exists.** Done 2026-09-12,
      v0.32.0. The five captions are about one world, nine Anchors and the
      centre; the title line under CONTINUE is the campaign in one line; the
      tagline, the two reset warnings and the won line no longer name the
      core, the chart, the Heart or the shards. The first-minute win is pinned
      by a design test (the pad is over Rustmoor's hall, a stock tank reaches
      it and climbs home) and filmed: roof at 48 s, THE ANCHOR WAKES at 56 s.

      Filming the intro found two first-run bugs the suite had been passing
      over since W9 and since round three respectively: the whole HUD drawn
      over the space flight (the crossing's CSS went with the crossing), and
      a SKIP button on every first run (its hidden class never had a rule).
      Both fixed, both now asserted on what is drawn rather than on a class.

- [x] **R9c A campaign the probe can finish.** Done 2026-09-13: the probe
      plays to the Vault (seeded from the wake, 27 runs to nine Anchors and
      5 more to the centre). It found that the laser was never buried, which
      is fixed, and taught itself to go round the sealed hall. `NOTES.md`.
      Original brief: `scripts/longplay.mjs` has never
      lit more than one Anchor, and its header says honestly why: four separate
      policy bugs of its own. Either give it a policy that can play the game -
      lateral travel to a column, a fuel rule, a climb that does not give up,
      and a stop condition that fires on arrival rather than on depth - or
      replace it with a policy-driven harness of the kind `TESTING.md`
      describes for the Godot games.

      The value is not the probe. It is that nothing currently proves the
      campaign is completable end to end, only that each piece of it works.

- [x] **R9d Ship it.** Done 2026-09-14, v0.42.0. `POLISH.md` walked line by
      line rather than assumed, and it refused three times before it passed.
      The deploy is GitHub Pages through CI; version, changelog and a screenshot
      at the phone's aspect went out together.

      **What the walk refused, and what it cost to clear:**

      *Visuals low/medium/high* (Shell). This game shipped one fixed setting -
      pixel ratio capped at 2, antialias on - and had never been caught, because
      the doctor's tier check looks for a Godot `src\game\visuals.gd`. Built as
      `visuals.ts`: four levers that are costs and never rules (resolution, mote
      count, growth density, rock relief), applied live with no reload, saved,
      and asserted by `test/visuals.test.mjs` plus two e2e specs that make the
      tier reach the renderer. Default is medium, not high, so the setting is
      not invisible to anyone who already has the game.

      *Screen sleep during play* (Shell). Never asked for. A descent in this
      game is one held thumb and no taps, which Android's display timeout does
      not count as activity, so the screen slept mid-run. `wakelock.ts`, held
      only while flying and given back in menus.

      *A stack on a rejected promise* (Shell). The `error` handler in
      `index.html` was fixed to print stacks in 2026-09-10 and the
      `unhandledrejection` one beside it was left bare - the wrong one to leave,
      since the faults that land there are the async ones whose message names no
      file.

      **What was checked and found already right:** the crash reporter (it is
      the first script in `index.html`, earlier than any module can be, prints
      the stack and offers a confirm-gated save wipe that also clears the
      service worker - a second one was written for this milestone and deleted
      as a duplicate); portrait lock; safe area; save on `visibilitychange`;
      version agreeing everywhere; credits; the content ladder; the second
      month sketched.

      **Deferred, and only what the carve-out allows:** the `perf` reading and
      the full launch-to-quit pass on the handset. `phone.ps1 devices` says not
      connected. Recorded in `NOTES.md` with the desk evidence that stood in,
      and owed on the next ship with a phone attached - now on two handsets,
      since the S22+ is the floor phone the low tier above is aimed at.

- [x] **R9e The second month, sketched.** Done 2026-09-13; the sketch is the
      section "The second month" immediately below this list. Original brief:
      `POLISH.md` asks for the next month's
      content to be in this file even if it is not built, and round eight ended
      the game without sketching what follows it. The design doc's own answer
      is "other planets are what comes after, later" - which is a direction and
      not a plan. Worth an hour once R9a says what the game actually is.

- [x] **R9f The way in, redone.** Done 2026-09-12, v0.33.0, as designed
      below; the three things the film found and fixed are in `NOTES.md`.
      His words on v0.32.0, 2026-09-12, three asks:

      1. *"redo the intro completely ... more of an eerie and high quality
         feel to it that matches the rest of the game."*
      2. *"if there are any transitions from flying in a cutscene to landing,
         I want an actual transition, not just a cut."*
      3. *"a very short intro after hitting the continue button ... only take
         a few seconds to start playing again."*

      The first is a restatement from scratch after R9b rewrote the words over
      the same picture, so the picture is wrong: a separate space scene with
      billiard-ball worlds and a sun, in a game whose every praised frame is
      dark rock under a lamp. The research (`C:\dev\plans\lattice\REFERENCE.md`)
      converges on one rule for the second ask - God of War, Half-Life 2,
      Journey: **do not build two cameras and hide the seam, build one camera
      and change what it does** - and on restraint for the first: silence
      broken by one sound (Limbo), the environment shown before the character
      (Hollow Knight, Dome Keeper), almost no text.

      So the intro plays IN THE GAME'S OWN SCENE, with the game's own camera,
      lamp, rock and pad, and there is nothing to cut between:

      - **Tap.** The hall in the dark, the Anchor's own glow the only light,
        TAP breathing at the thumb. The first touch is also what lets the
        audio start.
      - **The hall, 0-7 s.** The eye is inside Rustmoor's Anchor hall at 41 m
        - the one the first descent will cut into at 48 s - and a cold light
        breathes up over the cut stone and the Anchor in its niche. One low
        sound. Caption: *"Whoever cut these halls is gone."*
      - **The rise, 7-15 s.** The eye climbs to the surface through dark rock,
        the wind coming up under it.
      - **The surface at night, 15-21 s.** The pad and the Ballast in
        silhouette, the vent glow and the pad lights the only light, stars.
        Caption: *"Nine Anchors, buried across one world."*
      - **The descent, 21-28 s.** The ship's lamp comes down out of the dark,
        flames lit; the sky wakes from night to the world's own day as it
        comes; touchdown, dust, the HUD fades in, controls live. Caption:
        *"Light all nine, and the centre opens."*

      Twenty words, three lines, under thirty seconds, no white flash. A player
      who has won the game gets SKIP, which jumps to the descent.

      The title screen is the same surface at night with no ship on it.
      **CONTINUE** on a surface save drops the ship onto the pad in two
      seconds as the sky wakes; on a mid-run save the camera drops down the
      shaft to where the ship is and its lamp comes on, about a second and a
      half. No flight, no launch.

      `transit.ts` and `planet-normal.webp` are deleted in the same commit as
      the thing that replaces them (rule 12). The intro's timeline stays pure
      in `src/sim/intro.ts` so a test can walk it: the eye starts inside the
      first Anchor's hall (derived, never typed), ends at the surface, the ship
      ends on the pad, the first caption waits for the picture, and the whole
      thing is shorter than forty seconds.

- [x] **R9g The pad save, and CONTINUE as the intro compressed.** Done
      2026-09-12, v0.34.0, as below; `NOTES.md` has the one case to watch
      (an Anchor lit on an abandoned run). His words on v0.33.0, after
      *"I like the intro a lot more now"*:

      1. *"it starts below the ground, pans up, then it looks like it jumps
         over to the left to line up with the launch pad."* The eye rises in
         the Anchor's column, one right of the pad, and snaps across at the
         top. It eases across during the rise instead.
      2. *"a quick save to be done at the launch pad so that if someone
         exits out of the game, they start back at the launch pad, don't
         lose too much progress, but can't abuse the system."* A CHECKPOINT
         AT THE PAD: the save is only ever written while the ship is on the
         pad, so the run in progress when the app closes is not saved and
         CONTINUE always lands you on the pad with the state as you left
         it. Quitting mid-run then costs exactly what dying does - the hold
         and the run - and nothing else, which is what closes the abuse:
         there is no free ride home with the cargo, and no quitting out of
         a death. At most one run (about three minutes) is lost. A save from
         0.33.0 or earlier that was taken mid-run loads on the pad with the
         hold dropped, once.
      3. *"When you hit continue at the start screen, have the same starting
         point as new game but move the camera to the launch pad faster and
         don't display the text."* CONTINUE is the intro's own timeline
         compressed: the hall, the rise, the descent, no captions, under
         four seconds. And the title screen IS the hall - the Anchor's own
         glow in the dark under the wordmark - so both NEW GAME and CONTINUE
         start from the picture that is already on screen, with no cut.

- [x] **R9h Checkpoints at every large event.** Done 2026-09-12, v0.35.0,
      as below. His words on v0.34.0,
      2026-09-12: *"lets do a second save point at the anchor. If there are
      any large events like this, create save points for them too, and
      update the continue screen to go directly to their saved location
      instead of up to the launch pad first, then to them."*

      A checkpoint is written where the ship stands - tank, hull, hold and
      all - at each of: an Anchor lighting (which covers the planet
      answering and the centre opening), the Vault, a relic recovered, a
      device dug up. Quitting after one restores that moment, which is what
      dying would do to a run that had passed it, so there is still nothing
      to abuse; what a checkpoint can rewind is bounded by one run, as the
      pad save's is. The start handler no longer refills the tank unless the
      ship is on the pad. CONTINUE on a checkpoint: the hall's light comes
      up, the eye travels straight to the ship at 120 m/s (about three
      seconds to the Vault), and the ship's lamp comes on. A save tells the
      two kinds apart with an `at` field, which is also how an old mid-run
      save is still landed on the pad.

# Round ten: the polish round

His words on v0.37.0, 2026-09-13, in `playtests/lattice.md`. Four asks, and the
first is the frame the other three are evidence for: *"polish everything up ...
things that official games have that make them feel complete ... things that
arent specifically game issues but feel awkward."*

Measured before anything was designed, so these are faults rather than
opinions:

- **The dock is the whole top row, not the pad.** `atSurface()` is
  `g.pd <= -0.6` and nothing else, so flying up ANY of the 61 columns sells the
  hold, refills the tank, repairs the hull and lands a pending collapse. The
  game's own fuel model already disagrees with this: `findRoute()` paths to
  `key(START_X, -1)` - the pad - so the reserve on the dial has always been
  costed against returning to the pad specifically. One depth comparison is
  contradicting the arithmetic printed next to it.
- **The growth quads are buried in the rock.** The rock's displacement shader
  pushes its face outward by `ROCK_BUMP` - 0.16 on dirt up to 0.40 on rubble -
  from a face at z = 0.5. The growth quad is placed at a FIXED z = 0.52. So on
  ordinary stone the surface reaches z = 0.70 and the decal at 0.52 sits inside
  it, showing only where the noise happens to dip below it, and changing as the
  camera moves. That is the "pops in randomly", and it is also why it reads as
  low quality: what is on screen is a clipped fragment of a flat sticker.
- **The ship is steampunk and he no longer wants it to be.** A restatement from
  scratch rather than a refinement, which by standing rule 9 means the model is
  wrong, not the tuning.

- [x] **T1 The pad is the dock.** Done 2026-09-13, v0.38.0. Split the one function that is doing two
      jobs: `atSurface()` stays "above the ground" (heat, charge, the camera
      lift, the fuel reserve) and a new `docked()` is "at the pad" - at the
      surface AND within the pad's footprint. Selling, refueling, hull repair,
      the Outfitter, the Ballast, the supply refusal and the save all move to
      `docked()`. Standing rule 10: two facts that shared one function get one
      source of truth each, and a test asserts the derived quantity - that
      `findRoute()`'s goal cell and `docked()` agree about where the pad is.
      Forgiveness, because restricting re-entry must not strand anybody: the
      route home is already dug ground and already costed, the reserve on the
      dial already points at the pad, and the autopilot already flies there.

- [x] **T2 Growth that is a thing on the rock, not a sticker over it.** Done 2026-09-13, v0.38.0. His
      words: *"turn these into textures or physically different models instead
      of an overlay."* Real instanced geometry with volume, seated so it
      straddles the displaced surface instead of racing it - a tuft that starts
      inside the rock and protrudes cannot be buried by a bump, which is what
      makes the pop impossible rather than unlikely. Per-kind silhouettes, not
      one quad with six alpha masks. And the region swap stops changing every
      patch on screen at once.

- [x] **T3 A ship that is advanced and ancient.** Done 2026-09-13, v0.39.0. Not steampunk: no boiler, no
      raked stack, no spoked flywheel, no brass. Advanced technology that has
      been sitting for thousands of years, which is the same civilization that
      cut the Anchor halls - so the ship and the Lattice finally read as one
      world. Designed at thirty pixels first, as the hull it replaces was.

- [x] **T4 The completeness pass.** Done 2026-09-13, v0.40.0. The research's ranked
      list of what a shipped game has and a hobby build does not, audited item by
      item against this game rather than applied as a checklist. Two were real and
      are fixed; three were already true and the audit says so, which is the
      honest half of a pass like this.

      **Fixed. The d-pad let go of your thumb.** The keys bound `pointerleave` to
      a release, so a three-pixel drift ended a dig silently and a slide between
      keys dead-ended (leave fired on the key left, `pointerdown` never fired on
      the key reached, because the pointer was already down). `setPointerCapture`
      plus a hit-test on move. This is `FOUNDATIONS.md` principle 3, and it is
      NOT the forgiveness the research ranked first: input buffering was measured
      and rejected for this game, because the only press it refuses on a
      bufferable timescale is ordnance on an empty meter and `CHARGE_SECONDS` is
      42 seconds a point, so a 150 ms window bridges nothing.

      **Fixed. One tween, four speeds.** Fourteen transition declarations carried
      nine durations and four curve treatments, none of them chosen against the
      others. Now `--t-press`, `--t-fast`, `--t-base`, `--t-slow` and one
      `--ease`, with `test/tween.test.mjs` asserting the scatter cannot come
      back and asserting it is not inspecting an empty set.

      **Already true, checked not assumed.** Settings persist and apply live
      (last round). The title is not a frozen frame - two screenshots two and a
      half seconds apart show the motes and the ambience moving; only the camera
      is fixed, which is a framing choice. Edge states have their own polish:
      `.none` removes what you do not own rather than leaving it dead, `.cold`
      and `.idle` refuse with their own words, and death is cause-specific with
      alarm, flash, shake, haptic and spray. Haptics shipped in `haptics.ts`.
      Vlambeer's per-hit white flash was considered and does not map: damage to
      rock here is continuous progress through a cell, not discrete hits.
      Per-material juice variety is left, and the research ranks it last on
      purpose - a content multiplier, not a systemic fix.

# Round eleven: the professional-polish sweep

*2026-09-14, v0.43.0 to v0.48.0.* His words: *"look into and fix anything that
a professional game shouldn't have."*

**Every one of these was found by opening the game at a shape, a setting or a
state nobody had opened it at before.** The mechanical checks were clean - no
`console.log` in `src/`, no TODO or FIXME anywhere, no placeholder text, a
clean tree, and the doctor's full run with nothing but PASS lines against this
repo. The faults were not in the code's hygiene, and none of them would have
been found by reading it.

**Each has a test that asserts the INVARIANT rather than the number, and every
test was verified by putting the bug back.** That is the durable half: the
fixes are CSS and a few modules, the tests are what stop the next round of
work reintroducing them.

- [x] **E1 No control may be buried, and nothing may run off screen.** Measured
      at four shapes. On a phone held sideways MAP and BALLAST were 100%
      covered by the fuel dial, SHOP 55%, and AUTOPILOT was entirely off the
      bottom; on a 360-wide phone the cluster sat over half the left d-pad key.
      His own phone and a laptop were clean, which is why it stood - every
      screenshot this game has ever had was 460x996.

- [x] **E2 The camera may not frame more than is streamed.** The terrain is a
      21-column window and the camera was framing 40 columns on a sideways
      phone and 28.8 on a laptop, so the ground stopped in mid-air. `resize()`
      had a clamp for exactly this, written against the 63-column WORLD instead
      of the window, so it had never once fired. Portrait framing is unchanged
      and the test asserts that too.

- [x] **E3 The way out of a sheet is never below the fold.** The pause sheet's
      920 px of content in a 352 px box put RESUME out of sight with nothing
      saying so - in the only menu that unpauses the game.

- [x] **E4 `prefers-reduced-motion`, without losing the warning.** The shake
      goes to zero and the flash to 30%, and every pulsing warning is HELD at
      the loud end of its own swing instead of switched off - `fuelpulse` runs
      opacity 1 to .55, so `animation:none` would have left the dry-tank alarm
      looking exactly like a full tank.

- [x] **E5 The link describes itself.** No description, no Open Graph, no
      `apple-touch-icon`. For a game distributed as a link that is the front
      door. iOS was saving a screenshot of whatever was on screen as the icon.

- [x] **E6 Losing the GPU.** Android drops a WebGL context on a backgrounded
      tab, a driver reset or memory pressure. There was no handler, so three.js
      stopped drawing while the loop kept running: the game carried on
      simulating - fuel burning, heat climbing - behind a black screen with a
      live HUD, with no way out but killing the app. `preventDefault()` on the
      lost event is what makes it recoverable at all.

- [x] **E7 Every word on screen meets WCAG AA.** Two of 51 nodes failed and the
      worse one was the restart warning at 3.17:1 - the hardest text in the
      game to read was the warning on the one irreversible button in it.

- [x] **E8 A menu keeps the keyboard.** Tabbing with the pause sheet open
      walked into the HUD behind it. This game supports the keyboard on purpose
      (the Outfitter has a test for it), and half-finished keyboard support
      invites use and then fails.

- [x] **E9 A browser that cannot run it says why.** No WebGL check and no
      `<noscript>`. The common case is not an old phone, it is desktop Chrome
      with hardware acceleration off, and what those players got was a three.js
      stack trace.

**Two things were measured and found already fine**, recorded so nobody spends
the time twice: the save cannot outgrow its storage (digging out the ENTIRE
world is 232 KB against a ~5 MB limit) and there is no leak (14 MB of heap at
the pad, still 14 MB after digging to 43 m, booting in 804 ms).

# The Play listing

**These four landed in this repo without boxes, and a box is how the outline
stays true** (INDEX.md rule 3: one `- [ ]` line per milestone, ticked in the
commit that finishes it). Three of them were built by other sessions working in
this repo on 2026-09-13, which is why the plan did not have them; they are
recorded here rather than left uncounted, with the commit that did the work.
The reasoning behind each belongs to the session that wrote it and is in the
commit messages, not restated here.

- [x] **P1 A 512 PNG icon**, which the Play wrapper and the Android home screen
      both need. Done 2026-09-13, `76cd79a`.

- [x] **P2 The Android wrapper.** A Trusted Web Activity, so Google Play can
      list a web game at all: `scripts/twa.ps1` and `twa/`. Done 2026-09-13,
      `1e0bd12`. Its build output is `build/`, which is gitignored as of
      `ccf0dbd` - a `git add -A` in this repo had committed a 1.25 MB `.aab`
      into the pushed history.

- [x] **P3 The privacy policy** Play requires, and the one fact a web game has
      to state. Done 2026-09-13, `4056acc`, `PRIVACY.md`.

- [x] **P4 The store listing, rendered from the built game.** `npm run store`
      drives `scripts/store.mjs`, a filmstrip driver at 1080x1920 (16:9, because
      a 19.5:9 phone screenshot is rejected by Play), one frame per named state
      into `store/listing/en-US/`. Done 2026-09-13, `675ad99`. The listing does
      NOT go to Play from that commit - `autoListing` is off, and the three
      listing text files are drafts for Gideon to read. Two findings from its
      first run are filed as lessons: advancing the clock does not descend,
      because the ship digs while a control is HELD, and a pixel comparison
      cannot catch a wrong state in a game whose stars twinkle - assert the sim,
      not the picture.

- [x] **P5 Gideon reads the listing text.** **Approved 2026-09-19: "The listing
      looks good."** Title, short description and full description in
      `store/listing/en-US/`, as refreshed that day for rounds twelve and
      thirteen - the strained lode, which the copy had never mentioned at all,
      and the derelict drill ships.

      **This is approval of the WORDS and not of the ship.** The hold on V0 was
      given separately and in different words ("I will hold off on adding
      anything to the play store for now") and nothing here lifts it.

      Title, short description and full description are drafted in
      `store/listing/en-US/`. Nothing goes to Play
      until he has read them, and the PITCH is his call and not a session's -
      which is why the draft is flagged here rather than quietly rewritten.
      This box is his and only his; it is not waiting on any work.

      **The three factual errors this milestone used to name are fixed**, in
      `a401b59` (the v0.42.0 ship), and the body above said otherwise for a day
      after they were. Recorded rather than deleted, because the plan claiming
      a fault the repo does not have is the same failure in the other
      direction: the copy now opens on the Anchors and the Vault and says the
      campaign is the reason to go down, "nothing is chasing you" is gone for
      "nothing hunts you, but the ground is not safe" with the gas, heat and
      tremors named, and the ore order runs copper (`min: 3`) then iron
      (`min: 16`) with amethyst, emerald and ruby called by name.

      **Refreshed 2026-09-18 at his ask** ("then update the listing
      information"), because round twelve changed what the game IS and a listing
      that describes the version before it is the same fault this box was
      originally raised for. Two paragraphs are new - the marks under the depth
      readout, in the paragraph about the campaign, and a section on the eight
      buried devices including the Receiver, which is the first thing in the
      copy that tells a reader the world hands things over rather than only
      taking. The release notes are rewritten for 0.49.0.

      **Measured against Play's limits, 2026-09-18:** title 11 of 30 characters,
      short description 66 of 80, full description 2,351 of 4,000, release notes
      354 of 500. Nothing is near a cap, so his edits have room and none of the
      four needs cutting to fit.

      **Still his, and still unread.** Refreshing the facts is a session's job;
      the pitch is not, and nothing goes to Play until he has read it. The store
      lane cannot send it on its own either - `autoListing` is off and the Store
      tab's Sync button is the only path.

# The second month

> **ANSWERED 2026-09-18, and the answer retired candidate 1.** R9a happened: he
> played the build on his phone and liked it. His first sentence was *"I think
> any more than 7 anchors would feel like a checklist."* This section's
> ranked-first candidate was nine MORE Anchors in the deep, which is eighteen.
> It is dead, and the reasoning below is left standing rather than deleted
> because **why it was ranked first is the useful part**: it was chosen for
> being cheapest to build and best fitted to the world's existing shape, and
> nobody asked whether another nine of the same thing would feel like anything.
> That is the failure mode this note exists to leave on the record. What
> replaced it is **Round twelve**, below, and his ceiling is its governing rule.

**A sketch, not a plan, and it is deliberately not started.** `POLISH.md` asks
for the next month's content to be in this file even when it is not built, and
the reason to write it now is that round eight ended the game without saying
what follows it. Nothing here is committed to until R9a - a human play - says
what this game actually is.

## What the campaign leaves behind, measured

Round nine's probe finishes the game in about seventy game-minutes: five
Anchors in the first twenty-one, the remaining four in forty-two more, the
Vault in eight. That is the floor rather than the forecast - it plays badly on
purpose - but it tells us the shape of the problem. At the end:

- **The deepest quarter of the world is empty of objective.** Anchors live in
  the top three region rows by construction (`ANCHOR_ROWS = REGION_ROWS - 1`),
  so 339-452 m holds one hand-placed room, the Vault, and nothing else.
- **5.8% of the planet is authored** - 23 rooms, 1,764 cells. The other 94% is
  seeded rock, and it is the part a second month would have to make worth
  re-entering.
- **The ending hands the planet back** and means it: *"The ground is yours.
  There is more of it than you have seen."* Right now that sentence is a
  promise the game does not keep - nothing new exists after the Vault.
- **`g.won` already survives a reset**, and New Game Plus already offers the
  skip. The hook for a second pass is built and unused.

## The three candidates, in the order they are worth doing

**1. The deep, and a reason to be in it.** The cheapest real content and the
one the world is already shaped for: the fourth region row has palettes,
traits and ore and no objective at all. A second Lattice that only appears
once the first is lit - the Anchors were holding something DOWN, and the
Vault says so - puts nine more rooms in ground the player has learned to
survive but never had to stay in. Reuses the room stamper, the Anchor state
machine and the Unrest model whole; the new work is the hazard that makes
339 m different from 250 m, and heat is already there to build on.

**2. The relics as the collection that outlives the campaign.** There are
eight relics and one is buried per planet, which on a one-planet world means
a player sees one per playthrough. That is a collection nobody completes and
therefore a meta-goal that does not work. Either the relic moves to a
per-REGION drop (twelve, one per region, a shelf in the station that fills)
or it becomes the New Game Plus carry: what you keep, and what makes the
second pass differ from the first. The station room already has the geometry
for a shelf; `g.relics` already persists through a reset.

**3. New Game Plus as a changed world, not a faster one.** The flag is there
and the only thing it buys today is a skip button. The cheapest version that
is worth anything: the Anchors move (they are seeded, so a different offset
is a different hunt), the sealed three become five, and the planet starts
awake. No new systems at all - it is the wake threshold, the seal set and a
seed offset, all of which are constants.

## What this deliberately still refuses

**No combat**, for the reason round eight refused it: Dome Keeper's own
reviews say its two phases feel divided, and the fusion here is that the
pressure applies to digging itself. **No second planet.** The chain was
deleted in W9 and the whole of round eight is the argument against it; a
second world is the answer only if R9a says one world is exhausted, and the
measurement above says 94% of this one has never been authored at all.

## What to do next

**R9a, and nothing else.** Every item above is guesswork until a human has
played the campaign end to end. The probe can prove the game is completable;
it cannot say whether hunting Anchors feels like a hunt, whether the map is
worth opening, or whether the fifth Anchor lands. Those three answers decide
which of the three candidates is even the right question.

## What round eight deliberately did not do, and still has not

Carried forward from the round-eight design so it is not rediscovered:

**No combat.** Dome Keeper's own reviews say its two phases feel divided, and
the fusion here is that the pressure applies to digging itself. A second verb
imports the exact criticism the research warns about.

**No hand-authored secret world.** Animal Well is seven years of hand
placement and does not survive procgen. Authored templates in seeded slots is
the version that does, and that is what `src/sim/vaults.ts` is.

**No star chart.** It was a good screen for a game about visiting places and
this is a game about one place. It comes back if a sequel does.

# Round twelve: the world gets a voice

**His words, 2026-09-18, verbatim in `playtests/lattice.md`:**

> "I think any more than 7 anchors would feel like a checklist. For now, I like
> how everything is laid out. I want to get this first version onto the play
> store. Can you set up a plan to make the game feel more rounded and story
> like? Make more encounters and random events as you go. Make the game feel
> like it is pushing you in a specific direction, so it doesn't just feel open
> with no point to the game. Make sure the player knows the objective or is
> subtly pointed in the correct direction. Expand on all of these requests,
> research how to do this, then implement it."

## The five asks, numbered

1. **The Play store, for this version.** Ordered first by the word "first", and
   it is a separate track from everything below. `P5` is what blocks it.
2. **More rounded and story like.**
3. **More encounters and random events as you go.**
4. **Pushed in a specific direction, rather than open with no point.**
5. **The player knows the objective, or is subtly pointed at it.**

**2 through 5 are one problem in four voices**, and reading them separately is
how this round would get built wrong. The world is a place with no pressure and
no voice in it. Story, encounters, direction and objective are four different
symptoms of that, and the fix for all four is the same: **the world has to say
something.** They are kept as separate asks below only so that each can be
checked off against his words.

## The governing rule of this round

**The answer to "the game needs more" is never another Anchor.** Nine ship; he
has named seven as the ceiling where collecting stops being a hunt. Every
milestone here is checked against that rule, and the rule is the reason the
second month's ranked-first candidate is dead rather than deferred.

Read it as a ceiling on the COUNT and not as an instruction to cut: *"for now, I
like how everything is laid out"* is the sentence beside it, and nine laid-out
Anchors are what he likes. **What he is refusing is more collectibles in an
empty world**, which is exactly what the Anchors were being asked to supply and
exactly what they cannot.

## The diagnosis, measured rather than asserted

Four findings, each checked against the running build at v0.48.0 rather than
against memory.

**The objective is never on screen.** A screenshot of the pad at 375x812 shows
the whole HUD: the region name (`Rustmoor`), `HAUL ◈ 0`, `◈ 0`, `DEPTH 0 m /
452 m DEEP`, a fuel gauge, a d-pad, and five buttons. **Not one pixel names the
Anchors, the Vault or the Lattice.** The only goal-shaped number on screen is
`452 m DEEP`, which says go down and never says why. That single frame is most
of asks 4 and 5.

**The objective is stated at the door and never once inside.** It is three lines
in the intro (`src/sim/intro.ts`): *"Whoever cut these halls is gone."*, *"Nine
Anchors, buried across one world."*, *"Light all nine, and the center opens."*
The intro plays only when there is NO save, and a returning player gets the
title screen instead.

**This finding was first written as "never again to the player who comes back"
and that was too strong.** Shooting the title screen for V8 disproved it: it
carries *"Dig down. Light the Anchors. Open the center."* under the name and
*"Rustmoor - 140 m of 452 - 0 of 9 Anchors lit"* along the foot. A returning
player is told, clearly, on the way in. Corrected here rather than quietly
softened, because an overstated diagnosis is the same fault as a stale one and
this round has already retired one of those (M7).

**What was true is the sharper claim**, and it is the one V2 answered: the
objective was on the way IN and nowhere in the game. Once play starts, the
title is gone and the HUD named nothing.

**The tally exists but is buried.** `src/input.ts:371` renders `Anchors lit, of
nine` with a count - inside the pause sheet's record book, under Relics and
Records. It is a statistic in a menu, not a goal on a screen.

**94% of the world is silent.** 23 authored rooms, 1,764 cells, 5.8% of the
planet. The other 94% holds ore, three hazards and nothing that would ever be
retold. `src/sim/finds.ts` is the one exception and it is the proof the idea
works: seven devices buried in hashed cells, each granting a verb, each a small
story when it surfaces.

## What the research settled

Three briefs, 2026-09-18, kept at `C:\dev\plans\lattice\DIRECTION.md` and
`STORY.md` with their sources.

**Both independently reached his conclusion before being told it.** The
direction brief: *"the fix is not more Anchors - it's making the Ballast, the
Survey map and the Anchors' calmed/uncalmed state readable from a distance and
audible from underground."* The story brief: *"a wordless game's story is not
delivered, it is noticed."* His instinct and the reference games agree, which is
the strongest signal this round has.

**Direction, the three ingredients every reference game shares.** A
limited-visibility instrument that makes the unknown adjacent rather than
distant; a signal that ARRIVES from the world and can be ignored; and a visible
contrast between resolved and unresolved that reads at a glance without reading
a word. The Lattice already has the first (the lamp) and the third in data (lit
versus unlit regions) but has never drawn it where the player looks.

**Story, the four rules.** Push on what exists rather than adding. Make the wake
a visible rewrite of ground already dug. Keep every found record a silent
tableau rather than a log. **And pair every beat with a visual or haptic
carrier, never audio alone** - a phone game is played muted, and the sourced
finding is that needless audio gets muted immediately and stays muted.

**What the research says to SKIP**, recorded so it is not rediscovered: audio
logs and data slates (players skip them, and this game is muted-first), voice
acting, cutscenes (they contradict this game's own grammar, where the `#found`
banner is deliberately not a modal), Outer Wilds' dense knowledge web (needs
20+ nodes, and nine would read thin - and it is the most tempting way to
accidentally rebuild "more things to find"), and Hollow Knight's NPC-dialogue
half (needs a written character).

## The design

Four systems. Every one of them reuses machinery this repo already has, and not
one of them adds an Anchor.

**The Call - direction as an instrument, not a marker.** An unlit Anchor is
ancient machinery and it should be audible from underground. The ship gets a
RESONANCE reading in the instrument cluster that strengthens with true proximity
to the nearest unlit Anchor. It is warmer-and-colder, never a bearing arrow and
never a 3D waypoint: the player still has to choose a direction and dig it, which
is the decision the whole game is built on. The fiction and the instrument are one
object, which `mechanics\FOUNDATIONS.md` asks for.

**The receiver is one of the FINDS.** It is not owned at the start; it is dug up,
like the laser. That costs nothing extra (`finds.ts` is built and tested), makes
the direction system arrive as a discovery rather than as a UI feature, and means
the first descent is still the unguided one it should be.

**The objective, always legible.** A standing Anchor tally in the HUD's top
row, in the Lattice's own glyph rather than as a quest line, plus the Survey map
redrawn so lit and unlit regions separate at a glance. This is the cheapest
milestone in the round and it answers ask 5 almost by itself.

**Encounters - the 94% gets something to say.** Authored pockets stamped into
seeded slots, the way `vaults.ts` already stamps Anchor halls, each asking a
QUESTION the player answers with the verbs they have (fly, dig, carry, sell,
buy). No combat and no new verb. The detailed archetypes are in the milestone
table below.

**The world changes, which is the story.** The wake at the fifth Anchor is
already a threshold event and it is the shape to copy: a three-act grade over
the existing Unrest thresholds, the wake rewriting tunnels the player themselves
cut, and an ending that shows the dug world rather than only stating a sentence
about it.

## Milestones

Phase T, and the boxes are `- [ ]` or `- [x]` and nothing else (rule 3b).

- [ ] **V0 The Play store, this version.** *(HELD BY HIM, 2026-09-18: "I will
      hold off on adding anything to the play store for now." The box stays open
      and unticked because the work is not done, not because it is blocked - and
      nothing here should be pushed to Play until he says otherwise.)*
      Ask 1, and it runs beside the rest
      rather than after it. The machine side is done: listing text, four
      screenshots, feature graphic, 512 icon, release notes, the TWA, and
      assetlinks. The bundle is rebuilt at 0.54.0, version code 6, 4.31 MB - up
      from 1.29 MB because bubblewrap derives the splash screen from the icon
      and the icon is a photograph now; an AAB splits by density, so a phone
      downloads about 1.4 MB more than before rather than the whole 3 MB.
      **What blocks it is his, at the console**, and `C:\dev\PLAY-HANDOFF.md`
      lists it: the tester list (nobody can install from Play until an internal
      tester list exists and he opens the opt-in link on the phone), the
      category and contact email, and pressing Sync listing, which is the only
      way a listing reaches Google now that `autoListing` defaults off. Then
      promotion to closed, open or production, where the first production
      release goes through a Google review that takes days.
      **P5 is no longer among them** - the listing words were approved
      2026-09-19, "The listing looks good."
      **The session's part is DONE, 2026-09-19**, at his word ("complete what
      you can on your end"): `v0.54.0` carries `lattice.aab`, 4,308,819 bytes,
      version code 6. Play still carries v0.39.0 and will until he says
      otherwise.

      **And the release was NOT inert, which is the thing to read before doing
      this again.** `agent\store.ps1 -Auto` runs every Courier round, about
      every ten minutes, and its own documentation says *"a game with autoUpload
      on whose newest v* release holds a bundle not yet uploaded is uploaded to
      internal ... with nobody pressing anything."* `autoUpload` was TRUE for
      this game. Cutting the tag would have put the bundle on Play inside ten
      minutes and breached the hold - a bundle on Play cannot be withdrawn, only
      superseded. It was described to him as "my side, separate from the console
      which is yours", and that separation does not exist on this machine.

      He chose the safe order: `autoUpload` off first (through
      `store.ps1 -Action set`, not by hand, so the Courier's writer is not
      raced), then the release. **So flipping that switch back on is now part of
      lifting the hold**, and the dashboard's Store tab is where it lives. The
      one-key diff was verified before and after, and the `uploaded` record was
      watched across two Courier rounds and still shows only v0.39.0.

- [x] **V1 The Call.** `src/sim/call.ts`, pure and renderer-free:
      `resonance(x, d, lit)` is the loudest unlit Anchor's voice, 0..1, over a
      40-cell reach chosen against the region grid rather than by eye. **A
      proximity reading and deliberately not a bearing** - it answers "is one
      near here" and never "it is that way", because choosing a direction and
      digging it is the decision the game is built on, and an arrow deletes it.
      **Done 2026-09-18**, nine tests. The receiver that carries it moved to V2b
      with the needle, since a device with nothing drawing it is a dead key.

      Two things worth carrying forward. The monotonic-on-approach property
      belongs to `callFrom` (one Anchor) and NOT to `resonance` (the max over
      unlit ones), because walking toward a far Anchor while leaving a near one
      should make the reading fall - the first test asserted it on the wrong
      function and failed on the real layout, where three Anchors sit in a row.
      And the taken seed offsets are **11, 23, 41, 77, 91, 131, 137, 173, 211,
      257, 311, 313, 421, 601, 619, 977 and 1013**; this milestone needed none,
      because it rolls nothing.

- [x] **V2 The tally, always on screen.** Nine pips under the depth line that
      fill as Anchors are lit, and a tenth diamond for the Vault that opens only
      on the ninth. Pips and not `3 / 9` because the research is specific: what
      creates direction is a visible contrast between resolved and unresolved
      that reads AT A GLANCE without reading a word, and a count has to be read
      and compared. Built from `ANCHOR_COUNT` and never from a literal nine, and
      so is the e2e that counts them.
      **Done 2026-09-18, v0.49.0.** Verified by reintroducing the bug: opening
      the Vault pip one Anchor early fails the e2e naming it.

- [x] **V2b The resonance needle, which became a lamp.** V1's reading drawn in the instrument
      cluster, and the receiver that carries it added to `FINDS` so it arrives
      as a discovery rather than as a UI feature. Split out of V2 on 2026-09-18
      rather than left as a half-ticked box (rule 3b): the tally needed no new
      device and shipped the same day, and the needle needs an upgrade key, a
      display case in `station.ts` - which throws at boot without one - and the
      e2e that counts cases against `UPGRADES.length`.

      **Done 2026-09-18, and it is a LAMP rather than a needle.** `index.html`
      already carried the argument: a drill-load tachometer used to sweep around
      the fuel dial and was cut on a playtest because *"a gauge earns its
      movement by being read; this one was moving for decoration"*. Resonance
      changes with every metre flown, so a needle for it is that mistake with a
      different label. The lamp is dark most of the time and brightens when
      there is something to say. It carries visually, so any audio ping stays an
      addition and never the only carrier - the muted-phone rule.

      **The eighth device found a latent world bug**, which is the part worth
      remembering: a find crate is answered BEFORE the authored rooms, so one
      that hashed onto an Anchor hall's wall replaced it, and the eviction
      guarding against that only covered the three SEALED halls. `NOTES.md` has
      the two wrong fixes and why it needs both a footprint and the stamp. Three
      of the round's numbers also turned out to be derived rather than chosen -
      the price (3500 is the only value that fits the ladder at 48 m), the
      unlock depth, and the entry's position in `FINDS`.

- [x] **V3 The Survey map says which ground is settled.** Ask 5's other half.

      **The box's own premise was half wrong and that is worth recording.** It
      said "the map already knows; it does not currently say" - but the map
      already said it per ANCHOR, in three states, with a filled ring for lit.
      What it could not say was anything about the PLANET: nine rings over four
      screens of scrolling is a list, and reading it is counting. So the change
      is at REGION scale. A region whose Anchor is lit now carries its name in
      the lit ring's own mint, which spends a meaning the player has already
      learned instead of inventing a legend.

      **Done 2026-09-18.** Verified by reintroducing the bug, and the first
      version of that check passed when it should not have: three lit Anchors
      put three mint rings on the map whatever the names do, so a threshold of
      +40 pixels was satisfied by the rings alone. The three counts are measured
      into the test - 50 with nothing lit, 539 with the rings only, 1057 with
      the names calmed - and the bar sits at +700 where only the names can
      reach it.

- [x] **V4 The encounter frame.** One pure module: a weighted pool, a pity
      timer, once-only beats, and a seeded roll on its own offset, with the
      archetypes as data. No content yet - this is the frame the content lands
      in, and it is renderer-free and fully testable.

      **The three definitions this round works to**, from the research, because
      the whole ask turns on them. A **hazard** is an unconditional rule the sim
      applies with no choice attached - a gas pocket opening the hull is a
      hazard, and this game currently has only hazards. An **encounter** is a
      hazard made legible BEFORE it resolves: a visible tell, plus a response
      using a verb the player already has. An **event** is an encounter with a
      named, once-off decision that costs something on EVERY branch, which is
      what makes it retellable. Slay the Spire's Golden Idol is the clean case:
      four buttons and not one of them is free.

      **Two numbers the frame exists to enforce**, both measured in shipped
      games. Telegraph before the stakes land (Deep Rock's mission warnings,
      Terraria's "a goblin army is approaching"). And throttle repeats
      explicitly, or a good beat becomes wallpaper: Slay the Spire removes a
      one-time event from the pool once seen in a run, and Terraria decays an
      invasion's chance from 1/3 to 1/30 to 1/60 after it is beaten. Deep Rock
      caps it the other way, at most two mutators per mission and at most one
      anomaly, with at least one mission per rotation left clean. **A clean
      descent has to stay possible**, or the pressure stops reading as pressure.

      **Done 2026-09-18.** `src/sim/encounter.ts`, pure and renderer-free, on
      seed offset 431. Ten tests, and one of them earned its place immediately:
      *an uneventful descent is possible* failed on the first run, because
      `FIRE_CHANCE` had been picked by eye at 0.13 and that left one shallow
      descent in a hundred quiet, with 399 of 400 full dives hitting the cap.
      The replacement was measured across five values and the whole table is in
      the file - 0.025 leaves about half of shallow descents quiet and averages
      two beats on a full dive. Verified by reintroducing the bug: removing the
      gap rule fails two tests by name.

- [x] **V5 The first EVENT.** Was "the first three encounters", and scoping it
      changed the milestone rather than the schedule.

      **Two of the research's top three are already built**, which is why this
      is one thing and not three. The telegraphed gas pocket already telegraphs:
      `GAS.glow` is 0.45 against copper's 0.10 and goes through `coreGlow()`,
      the curve that deliberately does not switch off in unlit rock. The cave-in
      already warns: `tremorTick` has had a warning window for rounds. Both are
      ENCOUNTERS by the research's own definition - hazards made legible before
      they resolve - and the game has had them all along.

      What it had none of is an **event**: a once-off decision that costs
      something on EVERY branch. That is what neither gas nor a tremor asks,
      because the only honest answer to both is "avoid it".

      **The strained lode**, done 2026-09-18 as v0.50.0. Rock under load below
      90 m, worth more than any ore at its depth, and cutting it brings dug
      ground down behind you. Take it and the way home is one you find again;
      leave it and you walked past the richest thing on the descent while
      watching it glow. At 7 kg it is a cargo decision too. Measured density: 85
      to 113 per world, about one cell in 184 of the deep, so a descent meets
      roughly one and sees a couple it chooses to leave.

      The collapse is `planCollapse` and not a second path, so the guarantee
      that it reverts rather than stranding the ship is the one already written
      and tested. It can cost the easy way home and never the run.

      Eight tests, and four separate guards fired while building it - the
      collapse size was an invented number, the frozen overwriter list needed
      the deliberate entry, the census golden refused to record without a legend
      character, and the vestigial-fields census added this morning caught both
      new `g.planet` reads on the first code to touch it. `NOTES.md` has each.

- [x] **V5b The other two archetypes.** Closed 2026-09-19, and the two halves
      were closed differently. **Archetype 2, the cracked vein, is the lode**,
      and that was established by reading the brief's own row against what V5
      shipped rather than by opinion: *"a visibly rich, glowing vein sits just
      past a tremor-adjacent wall. Dig it now - big ore payout, tunnel collapses
      behind you, must find a new way out - or leave it and keep the safe path."*
      Point for point that is `LODE`: glow 0.78 against copper's 0.10, `min` 90
      against a tremor band starting at 85, the best value at its depth, and
      `LODE_COLLAPSE` cells of your own tunnel down behind you through
      `planCollapse`. Building it a second time would have been two of the same
      event competing for one descent, which is the wallpaper the encounter
      frame's cap exists to prevent. **Archetype 3 was the one genuinely
      missing, and it is W1 below.**

      **Also found while closing this: `src/sim/encounter.ts` has no caller in
      `src/` at all.** It is a tested pure frame that nothing in the game runs,
      because V5's lode and W1's wreck both turned out to be WORLD PLACEMENT
      rather than rolled beats - a lode is rock you cut and a wreck has been
      lying there for ever, and neither can be a thing a per-descent roll
      conjures without breaking the promise that a given planet plays the same
      beats in the same places. The frame's first real caller will be archetype
      4, the cave-in race, or 5, the buyer's spike, both of which genuinely are
      rolled. Owed and written into `NOTES.md` rather than deleted, because the
      frame is right and it is the content that has not needed it yet.

      **1. The telegraphed gas bloom.** The existing gas pocket gets a visible
      tell two or three cells out. That single change converts the game's most
      common hazard into a decision: vent it now for the ore behind it at hull
      risk, or route around it slowly. Small build, reuses the hazard whole.
      **2. The cracked vein.** A visibly rich vein sits past a tremor-adjacent
      wall. Dig it and the tunnel closes behind you and you leave by another
      way; leave it and keep the safe path. Medium build, needs a one-way
      collapse flag. One guaranteed per two or three regions, on a pity timer.
      **3. The derelict drill ship.** A wrecked prior ship in a seeded cell with
      salvage in its hold. No choice demanded, which is the point: it is the
      wordless tableau the story brief ranks second, and it is how the player
      learns this world holds more than hazards. A stamped micro-room of five to
      ten cells, guaranteed once per region.

      Each deterministic from a seed and asserted by a test. Archetypes 4
      through 8 are in `C:\dev\plans\lattice\ENCOUNTERS.md` and wait on these
      three being playtested first.

      **Two things found while scoping this on 2026-09-18, so the next session
      does not rediscover them.**

      **The gas bloom's TELL is already built.** `GAS.glow` is 0.45 against
      copper's 0.10, and glow goes through `coreGlow()` - the find-the-vein
      curve that deliberately does not switch off in unlit rock. So a gas pocket
      is already visible before you cut it, which by the research's own
      definition makes it an encounter rather than a hazard. What it lacks is
      the DECISION: there is no reason to cut one on purpose. The missing half
      is something worth taking behind it.

      **And that prize must be an OVERWRITER, never a change to the ore roll.**
      Biasing the roll near gas would move the ore stream, which is the one
      thing `blocks-frozen.json` exists to catch and the reason its legal-change
      list names `schematic` and `part` specifically: they replace a cell and
      consume no roll. A prize behind the gas gets its own seed offset and joins
      that list, or it does not ship.

      **Archetype 7, the fuel-leak cache, is REFUSED rather than deferred.**
      The research ranks it cheap and it is, but `INDEX.md` rule 16a names this
      exact failure: "a game that hand-rolls a fuel gauge is a game that will
      feel free again", because a fuel gauge always grows a rescue. Fuel is this
      game's clock and its whole stake. A pocket of free fuel mid-descent is the
      rescue, and it would cost the one decision the game is built on - turning
      round with half a tank. Recorded here so it is not picked up later as an
      easy win.

- [x] **V6 The wake rewrites what you dug.** The story brief's highest-ranked
      technique: at the fifth Anchor, tunnels the player already cut visibly
      change. Done 2026-09-18 as v0.52.0.

      **The card already promised it.** "The ground will not be as you left it
      any more" has been on the wake's card for rounds, and it was entirely a
      promise about the FUTURE - collapses begin, Blooms begin. Nothing touched
      the tunnels already dug, which is the half the sentence actually claims.
      Hollow Knight is the reference the research gives: the Infection reads as
      a story beat rather than as decay precisely because it is applied to
      ground the player already walked clean.

      **It takes one cell at a time, and that was measured rather than
      assumed.** The first version asked in bites of three and closed NOTHING on
      a shaft-and-gallery fixture: `planCollapse` is all-or-nothing about the
      route home, a vertical shaft is the only way up, and three cells almost
      always contains one that is holding it. Singly, the spare cells land and
      the load-bearing ones revert.

      Measured on four shapes, route home surviving every one: a bare shaft
      closes 3 of 12, shaft plus one gallery 9, shaft plus three galleries 12, a
      worked-over planet 12. That gradient is the design rather than a
      compromise - **what you lose is what you dug and did not need**, so a
      player who drilled one straight hole loses almost nothing because they
      have nothing spare.

- [x] **V7 The three-act grade.** Done 2026-09-18 as v0.51.0, and driven off the
      CAMPAIGN rather than off the Unrest meter the box asked for.

      **That swap is the milestone's one real decision.** Unrest is per-region
      and it rises and falls, so a grade on it would flicker every time you
      crossed a boundary - a world whose mood changes every twenty metres has no
      acts, it has weather. The campaign thresholds are monotonic and every one
      of them is something the player did, which is what an act is.

      Act one is the dead planet and changes nothing, so a first hour is the
      calibrated picture every lighting note was tuned against. Act two is the
      wake, tinted toward the ember the heat line already uses, because it is
      the only act where the planet is against you. Act three is the Vault
      opened: quieter than act two AND quieter than act one, desaturated toward
      the Anchors' own mint. That last one is the point - the ending says *"the
      ground is yours"* and the second month's own measurement is that the
      sentence is a promise the game does not keep. A grade cannot add content,
      but it can make the place LOOK handed back.

      **The first version graded only the sky and the fog, and at 19 m down a
      side-by-side of act one against act three showed almost nothing.** Of
      course it did: in a shaft you are looking at rock lit by your own lamp and
      the sky is a strip at the top of the frame. The haze colour and the
      parallax tint carry it now, which is what the deep actually looks like.
      The haze GAIN is untouched, because that is the constant with five
      playtest rounds behind it.

      Ambient is left alone on purpose - pulling it is how a grade becomes a
      filter, and `CLAUDE.md` is explicit that a world needing to look different
      is a change to the lights and not to the field. Seven unit tests on the
      dramatic shape and an e2e that reads the sky the game actually paints.
      Verified by reintroducing the bug: flattening act two's tint fails the e2e
      with "the wake does not change the sky at all, so act two is invisible".

- [x] **V8 The first ten seconds show a ruin.** The story brief's first-minute
      finding: worked geometry in view before it is reachable, no text.

      **Already true, and the box was written on a wrong assumption.** It said
      the returning player "never sees the intro at all" and therefore lacks the
      shot. They do not see the intro, but they see the TITLE, and the title
      screen IS the first Anchor's hall in the dark with the Anchor's own glow
      the only light in it. Shot at 1080x2340 on 2026-09-18 to check rather than
      to trust the comment: cut stone walls standing in rough rock, one glowing
      goal-shaped object in the middle of them and no way to reach it yet, which
      is exactly the Dark Souls / Hollow Knight / Inside opening the research
      describes. It also carries "Dig down. Light the Anchors. Open the center."
      and "0 of 9 Anchors lit".

      Ticked on the evidence rather than built, and the diagnosis above was
      corrected in the same pass - it had claimed the returning player is told
      the objective "never again", and this screenshot is what disproved it.

- [x] **V9 The ending shows the world.** A pull-back over the dug planet behind
      the existing card, so the ending hands back a place the player can see
      they made. Done 2026-09-18 as v0.53.0.

      **The camera DISTANCE and nothing else.** The framing in `resize()` is
      eighteen rows solved against the panel and multiplied by the Scanner, and
      it took five sessions of lighting work to calibrate; a bespoke ending
      camera would be a second framing to keep in step with the first for ever.
      `camZBoost` is an additive scalar the camera already has for this shape of
      thing, so the ending is a number added to it and the existing frame logic
      is untouched.

      Rise, hold, fall over six seconds. **The hold is the milestone** - a
      pull-back that turns round the instant it arrives reads as a camera error,
      and the research's whole point is that the player gets a moment to look at
      what they dug. Started when the Vault is reached rather than when the card
      closes, so it runs behind the card: the card is the moment they look away
      from the frame, not at it.

      Two receipts, for the same reason V7 needed two. The unit tests pin the
      curve's shape - starts and ends at zero, monotonic each way, actually
      holds at full extent - and an e2e reads `camera.position.z` off the
      running game, because the curve being right and nothing moving on screen
      is precisely how V7 shipped invisible earlier in this round. Verified by
      reintroducing the bug: shrinking the pull-back to 0.2 fails the e2e with
      "the shot never reached a frame".

**V0 through V3 are the round's first delivery** and they are the ones that
answer asks 4 and 5. V4 and V5 answer ask 3. V6 through V9 answer ask 2.

## Round thirteen: the icon

His ask, 2026-09-19, in full: *"That looks good to me. One thing I would like to
have updated is the app icon. Can you update it to something that matches the
more realistic textures on the rock, and feel of the game?"* One ask, and it is
a stand-in described as a preference - the icon was the planet-and-core
objective that round eight removed, still shipping on the launcher, the tab, the
shared link and the store listing five rounds later (rule 12, whose note names a
replaced OBJECTIVE as the most expensive stand-in there is).

- [x] **W1 The icon comes off the game.** Done 2026-09-19 as v0.53.1.

      **Shot, not drawn.** `scripts/icon.mjs` drives the built game the way
      `shot.mjs` does - serving `dist`, through `?debug`, advancing game time -
      hides the HUD, and crops a square out of the frame. A hand drawing cannot
      be checked against a picture it is not made of and drifts the moment the
      art does, which is exactly how the old one got five rounds out of date.

      **It renders at the PHONE's aspect and crops**, rather than rendering into
      a square viewport, because `resize()` solves eighteen rows into a camera
      distance from the viewport HEIGHT: a square viewport is a legal framing no
      player ever sees, with eighteen columns in it. At deviceScaleFactor 2 and
      downsampled, which is supersampling, and is what makes the rock grain
      survive at 512 rather than alias into speckle.

      **Judged at 48dp, not at 512.** Five candidates were rendered - the shaft
      at four crops, a side gallery, and the Anchor hall - and each one was
      written out at both sizes. The hall disqualified itself by firing the
      Anchor card over the frame. `shaftmid`, a 640 px crop centred on the ship,
      is the one that keeps a machine in it at launcher size instead of a glow.

      **All four renderings move together or none of them do.** The 512 raster,
      the flat `icon.svg` the browser may pick instead of it, Android's themed
      alpha and the store's copy are four renderings of one picture, and the
      failure they have is that one changes and nobody sees it, because whichever
      you are looking at is the one that is showing. `test/icons.test.mjs` is the
      receipt: the manifest's icons all exist, the rasters are 512 square and
      32-bit, the themed one still HAS an alpha, and its alpha's bounding box
      equals the `<rect>` in its own SVG, so editing the vector without running
      `icon.mjs --mono` fails rather than ships. Verified by reintroducing both
      bugs - moving the SVG rect 32 px fails with the two numbers and the command
      to run, and flattening the themed PNG fails with "covers 100.0% and has
      lost its transparency".

      Not done here, and deliberately: the feature graphic, which is already a
      real frame of the game and needs nothing.

- [x] **W2 The derelict drill ship.** Done 2026-09-19 as v0.54.0. Archetype 3 of
      the research's ranked list, and the half of his round-twelve ask that the
      lode did not touch: *"more rounded and story like."* A wrecked prior ship,
      one per region, twelve on the planet.

      **A room, not a roll.** It is a `Vault` template like the Anchor halls and
      the expedition room, with three new characters: `H` hull plate, `S` the
      hold, `L` the ship's own lamp still faintly on. Eighteen plates, one hold,
      one lamp, six cells of spoil where it ploughed in.

      **Its own slots, and NOT the `WILD` pool, which is the load-bearing
      decision.** `wildSlot` picks with `WILD[floor(rnd(..) * WILD.length)]`, so
      a thirteenth entry changes the divisor and moves rooms at all sixteen
      slots on a world the seed promises is fixed. Placed last in `vaultPlan`
      instead, one per region on offset 733 with `anchorAt`'s own geometry, and
      dropped whole on any overlap. Every room that existed before this round is
      bit-identical and a wreck can only take cells the generator made.

      **The retry ladder was measured, and then re-measured.** One attempt each
      placed eight of twelve - region 10 draws a cell the Vault is standing on,
      which it can never win. Six places all twelve once the `CACHE.min` floor
      squeezed the shallow row into a shorter band, where four had sufficed
      before it; the constant is eight, so retuning some other room cannot
      silently cost a region its wreck, and a test asserts all twelve rather
      than trusting the margin. That a change somewhere else entirely moved this
      number is the argument for the margin.

      **What it pays: a derivation that was sound about the wrong source.** The
      hold first paid `BLOOM.value`, on the rule that the game sorts prizes by
      what they COST and a wreck asks only for a detour, as a Bloom does. The
      rule was right; **a Bloom is gated on `isAwake`**, so its 4,200 is priced
      against a five-Anchor economy, while a wreck is gated on nothing and
      Rustmoor's drew 13 m. The hold is a cache now: `cachePrize(x, d)` has
      always handed over the deepest minerals a depth allows, which is balanced,
      tested, and the better fiction - a hold holds what that crew had dug, and
      they dug where they died. Hull hardness stayed the midpoint of worked and
      sealed stone.

      **Three e2e tests failed on this and all three were right.** The shallow
      materials guard caught the flat price (and the one-word fix that would
      have silenced it is recorded beside the list it tempted me to edit). The
      cache-rarity guard then caught the hold walking under `CACHE.min`, a
      deliberate pacing gate, so `derelictAt` floors at `CACHE.min + VAULT_H/2`.
      And the drilling-collision test had hard-coded column 6 for eleven
      versions, which a wreck now stamps over; it searches for plain rock now,
      because its claim was never about that column.

      **Three separate things had to be fixed by LOOKING, and none of them was
      visible in the code.** The first build was judged from inside a shaft and
      passed; shot side-on it was obviously a patch of pale rock. (1) The hull
      fell through `ROCK_BUMP` to the default 0.2 and bulged like stone. (2)
      Flattening it was not enough - the rock normal and roughness maps are
      still painted across it, so it came back a polished slab; a made surface
      needs NO grain, which is the new `MADE` set in materials.ts. (3) The lamp
      had glow 0.88, correct emissive, and was completely invisible in unlit
      ground, because blocks.ts emits the additive halo on the `ore` path alone
      and the halo is what carries a glow through rock. It now uses the Anchor's
      `ore: true, spoil: true` pair, and the test says why so nobody tidies it
      away. The hold also drew as white gems until it was given the crate
      geometry: it is somebody else's haul, not something the planet grew.

      Twelve tests in `test/derelict.test.mjs`, three guards fired while
      building it (the census golden, the vestigial-fields census, and the
      overwriter set), and two faults were planted and seen to fail. A third
      planted fault corrected a claim in `blocks.test.mjs` that was simply
      wrong - see the note there.

## Round fourteen: rarity, usefulness, and what an Anchor gives you

His brief, 2026-09-19, after the first real play of 0.54.0. Five asks, numbered
here in his order, and the verbatim words are in
`gamedev-notes\playtests\lattice.md`:

1. **Make materials feel more rare** - "I want it to feel exciting when you find
   resources."
2. **Make them more useful** - "so they feel like you are searching for them."
3. **Abilities on each Anchor.**
4. **The first Anchor's ability is the map**, showing where minerals, secrets or
   a higher concentration are, only in regions whose Anchor is lit.
5. **The Anchor is a physical thing at that spot that you cannot dig**, glowing,
   visibly powerful.

Research: `C:\dev\plans\lattice\RARITY.md`.

### The measurement that decides asks 1 and 2

Taken before any design, on planet 0, by flood-filling every ore cell into
deposits of the same id:

    ore         deposits  cells  mean size   biggest
    copper           292    307      1.05        3
    iron             355    370      1.04        3
    gold             213    219      1.03        2
    ruby              82     83      1.01        2
    magmite           40     40      1.00        1
    coreite           23     23      1.00        1
    umbrite           13     13      1.00        1
    solmarrow          5      5      1.00        1

**Every ore in this game is a single isolated cell.** There are no veins
anywhere and never have been. Finding gold gets you one gold: the number goes up
and you move on, which is exactly the "it does not feel exciting" he is
reporting. And the deep ores are already savage - solmarrow is five separate
single cells on the whole planet, about one in 980 below its own floor - so
lowering a spawn rate would not make it exciting, it would make it absent.

The research says the same thing from the other side and it is the one finding
that governs this round: **lowering a rate alone is not shown anywhere to
increase excitement.** The excitement lives in the reveal and in the material
having a named use. Every game surveyed clusters its rarest resource -
Minecraft generates ore as vein blobs rather than single blocks, Deep Rock's
Nitra bulges out of cave walls in clumps that read from a distance.

So "more rare" is the right instinct pointed at the wrong number. Clustering the
SAME total supply into far fewer, richer veins makes a find rarer in the only
sense that matters - the number of separate find-events - while making each one
a place you stop and work. Total supply is unchanged by construction, so nothing
else in the economy needs rebalancing.

- [x] **X1 Ore comes in veins.** Done 2026-09-19. The round's biggest change and the answer to
      ask 1. Each ore's cells cluster into blobs around rolled vein sites
      instead of rolling independently per cell. **Total cells per ore stay
      within a few per cent of what they are now** - this is a change to WHERE
      ore is, not how much, and the test asserts that rather than trusting it.

      Rolled on its own seed offset like every other feature (the taken list is
      in `world.ts`), and on a coarse lattice rather than by rejection sampling,
      for the reason `wildSlot` gives: a lattice cannot fail to terminate and a
      seeded world has to generate the same ground every time it is asked.

      **This re-records `test/baseline/blocks-frozen.json`, which has happened
      exactly once before** (round seven, a deliberate ore rebalance, diff read
      first and written down). That is the bar: read the diff, write down what
      moved, and only then re-record. The census golden moves with it.

      Open question for the build, to be measured and not guessed: whether ALL
      eleven ores cluster or only the deep ones. Clustering copper changes the
      first ten minutes, which is the part of the game he has said he likes.

- [x] **X2 A rare find announces itself.** Done 2026-09-19. Ask 1's other half, and the research
      ranks it first because it is cheap and carries most of the feeling:
      Diablo III's Loot 2.0 gave each rarity tier its own light and particle so
      a rare item reads as rare before you read its stats. Here that is a
      stronger halo pulse and its own sound for the deep tiers, reusing the
      halo and audio graph that already exist.

      **Not to be confused with the first-of-its-kind banner**, which already
      exists and fires once ever per material. This is every time.

- [ ] **X3 One or two materials become keys rather than currency.** Ask 2.
      Materials already gate upgrades through `matCost`, so the change is
      narrowing: name an EXACT small count of a named deep material for one or
      two specific things, the way Deep Rock's resupply costs exactly 80 Nitra
      and Terraria's tiers are hard-gated by pickaxe power rather than by price.

      **Very few, deliberately.** Dome Keeper's designer capped the whole game
      at three resource types, arguing more "would add more information to
      comprehend", and the research's stated risk is that doing this to many
      ores collapses back into currency with extra steps.

- [x] **X4 The first Anchor's gift: the Survey map shows where the ground is
      rich.** Done 2026-09-19. Asks 3 and 4. An aggregate richness read per REGION, rendered as
      two or three heat tiers over that region's tiles, and shown only for
      regions whose Anchor is lit - exactly the gate the map reveal already uses.

      **REGION grain, never per-cell, and this is the fence.** The Lattice
      Receiver gives proximity and never bearing because choosing a direction
      and digging it is the decision this game is built on. The research's named
      failure mode is No Man's Sky's Analysis Visor, which pins exact nodes and
      whose own community describes it as reducing exploration to walking to
      icons. Valheim's Wishbone is the precedent to copy: it tells you nearer
      and never which way. A region is 15 columns by 113 metres - knowing one of
      those is rich is a reason to go there and is not a map to anything.

      It is a READOUT and not a traversal key, which is why it is a fine thing
      for the first Anchor to grant: it opens no locks, so it creates no
      backtracking debt.

- [ ] **X5 The ability ladder, designed and not yet built.** Ask 3 in full. The
      research's shape, from GMTK on Hollow Knight: early abilities deliberately
      open only a few locks so there is no reason to backtrack; ONE middle
      ability opens many locks at once across ground already walked, which is
      what turns a guided sequence into a search space; the last two or three
      each do double duty, advancing the ending AND giving a reason to revisit.

      **Only the first is being built this round**, because it is the only one
      he named. Eight abilities invented by a session and shipped unseen is the
      opposite of "when he names a mechanism, build that mechanism" - the other
      eight go in this plan as proposals for him to edit, and get built once he
      has played the first.

      **The tension to settle with him:** he has said more than seven collectible
      things reads as a checklist, and there are nine Anchors. The research
      flags it rather than resolving it and so does this: the ceiling plausibly
      applies to optional pickups rather than to a mandatory chain, but that is
      his call and not a session's.

- [x] **X6 A lit Anchor stays a monument.** Done 2026-09-19. Ask 5, and the interesting one,
      because the game already half does it. `blockAt` gives an unlit Anchor
      `hard: Infinity` - it cannot be cut by the drill, a charge or the laser.
      A LIT one is deliberately cuttable at three times the band, and the note
      there says why: three Anchors share each of the three columns they sit in,
      and while they stayed unbreakable the shallowest in a column was a plug
      the ship could not pass. Six of the nine were unreachable.

      So he is not asking for something the game refuses; he is reporting that
      **the monument does not read as one**, and the half he has met is the half
      he can drill through. **The fix must not revert that bug fix.** It is a
      TRAVERSAL problem wearing a digging problem's clothes, and the answers are
      to let the ship pass through a lit Anchor - it is a light now, not a wall -
      or to have the hall open a way past when it lights. Whichever is chosen,
      the Anchor is never cuttable again, and the regression test is the one
      that found the plug: every Anchor lights by digging down its own column.

## Round fifteen: the descent becomes a ladder

His brief of 2026-09-19, rewritten to the format `techniques/instruction-design.md`
sets out: one subject a rule, the TRIGGER first, the reason as a clause rather
than a paragraph, the receipt named, and about 120 words a part. His words are
in `gamedev-notes\playtests\lattice.md` verbatim and are the authority; this is
the reading of them, not a replacement for them.

**The sentence the brief turns on is "it should also work backward from how we
have it".** Today the Anchors are a COLLECTION that ends in a Vault - nine of
them anywhere on the planet, lit in any order, and the ninth opens the centre.
He is asking for a LADDER: a few Anchors per tier, each tier ending in a gate
you break to descend. The current structure pays once, at the very end. A ladder
pays at every tier, which is the same sentence as "building in intensity as you
find more".

### The asks, numbered by their trigger

**Y1, at a depth the player has not earned yet: a forcefield stops the ship.**
The world is cut into tiers by barriers the drill cannot pass. Default is
blocked; the exception is a tier whose gate has been broken. Reason: a depth you
cannot reach is the only thing that makes reaching it an event. Receipt: a test
that walks the ship down every column and finds it stopped at each tier edge
until the gate for that tier is broken.

**Y2, when N Anchors of a tier are lit: a dark-energy core appears.** It looks
inviting and it is the only thing in the tier that can open the gate. Default is
absent; it exists only once the tier's Anchors are lit. Reason: the Anchors stop
being a checklist the moment lighting them visibly does something local.
Receipt: a test that the core is absent at N-1 and present at N.

**Y3, when the core is destroyed: the forcefield below it drops.** One core, one
tier, for ever - it does not come back. Reason: a gate that can re-lock is a
chore. Receipt: the Y1 test, run after breaking each core in turn.

**Y4, when the core is destroyed: the player gains one new ability.** One per
tier and never a number - a verb or a lens, not a bigger tank. Reason: the
research's rule from Hollow Knight is that each key opens a few locks, and a
numeric upgrade opens none. Receipt: a test that every tier grants exactly one,
and that no two tiers grant the same.

**Y5, when the first core is destroyed: planet integrity appears, and it is
falling.** Before that it does not exist on screen at all. Reason, his: "the
structure integrity of the planet feels more like a status bar than something
integral" - a readout shown before it can be acted on is furniture. Receipt: a
test that the HUD carries no integrity element until the first core is broken.

**Y6, when each further core is destroyed: integrity falls faster.** The
player's own progress is what is breaking the planet. Reason: this is the
brief's whole source of escalation, and it costs no new content. Receipt: a test
that the decay rate after k cores is strictly greater than after k-1, and that
it is bounded.

**Y7, when the player repairs the planet: it is an activity, not a payment.**
Feeding materials to a bar is named in the brief as the thing to avoid. Reason:
a donation has no decision in it, and this game's whole shape is decisions about
where to spend a descent. Receipt: a test that repair cannot be completed from
the pad, and that it consumes something other than credits.

**Y8, at every tier gate: a shop and a save point.** Each barrier is also a
place to stop. Reason: a gate is already the one cell every player in that tier
passes through, so it is where a service costs no new world. Receipt: a test
that each tier has exactly one, at its own gate.

**Y9, buying at the first shop: a cap on what it will sell.** The starting shop
holds few upgrades and stops. Reason, his: "to make sure everything stays
balanced" - an early game that can buy late-game power has no late game.
Receipt: a test that the sum of what tier one can sell is under a measured
ceiling.

**Y10, buying at a deeper shop: more, and abilities as well as numbers.**
Reason: the shop ladder is the progression, so a deeper shop has to be visibly
worth reaching. Receipt: a test that each tier's catalogue strictly contains the
one above it.

**Y11, drawing any shop: it is redesigned.** His words: "redesign the shops
completely using your own skills and research, to give me something that looks
and feels better suited for the game." One-thumb portrait, thumb-reach zones,
locked versus unaffordable distinguished. Receipt: the existing e2e that every
upgrade has a display case, plus a new one that no control sits outside the
thumb arc at the shapes the game opens at.

**Y12, throughout: more secrets.** His words: "make it feel like there are
always more secrets to find." This is the one ask with no mechanism attached to
it and it is deliberately last - the derelicts, the lode and the veins are all
recent answers to it, and what it needs is a measurement of how often a descent
meets anything at all before more is added.

### What this REPLACES, which is the expensive part

Rule 12: a replaced objective is the most expensive stand-in there is, and two
structures in one game is worse than either. Everything here is in the path of
the brief and has to be resolved rather than left beside it.

- **The Vault ending.** Nine Anchors opening the centre is the current climax.
  A ladder of tier gates is a different spine.
- **The Ballast as a bar you feed**, which Y5 and Y7 replace outright.
- **The single pad shop**, which Y8 turns into the first of several.
- **The flat upgrade tree**, which Y9 and Y10 re-cut by tier.
- **The wake at the fifth Anchor**, whose job - the planet answering partway
  through - is what Y6 now does at every tier.
- **Nine Anchors.** A ladder wants a few per tier; nine over four tiers is two
  and a bit, which is not a number.

### Three things the brief does not settle, and guessing them would be expensive

- [ ] **Y0a Is the Vault still the ending?** A ladder of gates could end AT the
      Vault - the last gate is its door - or the Vault could go the way the
      planet core went in round eight. Both are coherent and they are different
      games.
- [ ] **Y0b What does a save point save you from?** Death is a tow today: you
      lose the hold and nothing else, and the game saves continuously. A save
      point in the sense the word usually carries implies losing progress
      between them, which is a far larger change than the shop half of Y8.
- [ ] **Y0c What does "released" or "broken" mean for an Anchor?** Hours before
      this brief he asked for an Anchor that is "physically located at that spot
      that you can't dig", and X6 made it permanently uncuttable. "Once the
      anchors are broken" reads as the opposite. Most likely the dark-energy
      CORE is the thing broken and the Anchors are still lit - but that is a
      reading, and the two words are his.
