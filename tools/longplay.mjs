/* longplay.mjs - a whole campaign, driven through the real game.

   W10's brief is "a long play of the whole thing rather than of any one
   milestone", and the thing round eight built is a campaign: nine Anchors
   spread across a 61-by-452 world, a Ballast that drains while you work, ground
   that closes once the planet wakes, and an ending at the centre.

   None of that can be judged from a unit test, because every number in it is
   about how the pieces meet: whether the Ballast can actually be kept up while
   you are hunting, whether Unrest outruns the Anchors that push it back,
   whether the ground closing faster than you cut turns the second act into
   re-digging the first.

   So this drives the SHIPPING loop in a real browser, on the tick seam, and
   reports what the campaign looked like. It plays badly on purpose - it flies
   straight lines and does not think - so every number here is a floor rather
   than a forecast.

   Run:  node scripts/longplay.mjs            (needs the preview server up)
         node scripts/longplay.mjs --anchors 9 --minutes 90

   ---------- WHAT THIS HAS AND HAS NOT PROVED ----------

   Read this before believing a number out of it.

   PROVED, and it is why the script exists: the first half hour of a campaign
   is healthy. Runs come out at about three minutes of game time, which is what
   the design says a run should be; the Ballast can be kept full out of banked
   ore once income arrives; Unrest reaches about 0.05 mean and 0.11 peak in
   thirty minutes, which is well inside Calm; and the money curve climbs
   without a wall in it.

   FOUND, which is the real return: a lit Anchor was an unbreakable plug in its
   own column, so six of the nine were unreachable by digging down to them; and
   the collapse cascade had no bottom, losing a planet's third region four
   minutes after its second. Both are fixed and both now have their own tests -
   `every Anchor lights by digging down its own column` in the smoke suite, and
   the spiral tests in test/unrest.test.mjs.

   NOT PROVED: that a campaign can be played to the Vault. This probe has never
   lit more than one Anchor, and every time it stalls the cause has turned out
   to be its own policy rather than the game - it has had four separate bugs of
   its own (an eighteen-cell lateral overshoot, no fuel policy at all, a climb
   that gave up because it was in danger, and then a stop condition that fires
   before the first slice when the ship is already deep). **The game's own
   reachability is proved by the smoke test, not by this.**

   The honest state: this is a good instrument for the first half hour and an
   unfinished one past it. Anybody picking it up should expect to fix its
   policy again before it gets to nine.                                     */
