/* econ.mjs - what a player actually earns, and when they buy each thing.

   `CRAFT.md`: measure a progression by simulating play - bank, buy, next
   level - and report the level each thing is reached at. Dividing a late price
   by early income measures a player who never got better, which is nobody.

   This drives the REAL pure layer through the same bundle the golden tests
   use, so every number below comes from the shipping generator, the shipping
   ore table, the shipping prices and the shipping fuel and heat rules. What it
   models rather than executes is only the part that lives in the frame loop:
   where the ship flies and which cell it points at. Those are stated as
   assumptions at the top of the report, because a probe that hides its model
   is a probe you cannot argue with.

   Run:  npm run econ            (all three styles)
         node scripts/econ.mjs --style greedy --runs 40

   It changes nothing. It is safe to run against a working tree at any time. */

/* ---------------- the model ----------------

   One run is: fly or cut down a shaft, work a seam at the bottom, climb out,
   sell. The three things the frame loop decides and this has to assume:

   1. The shaft is straight and is reused. The first descent cuts it; later
      runs fly down it. That is what a player does and it is why run two is so
      much faster than run one.
   2. Work at the bottom is a corridor cut sideways from the shaft, taking
      every cell in it. That matters: in this game EVERY broken block goes in
      the hold, dirt included, so the hold fills with what is in the way and
      not only with what is worth money.
   3. No tremors, no gas, no caches. They are variance around this line, not
      the line. */
